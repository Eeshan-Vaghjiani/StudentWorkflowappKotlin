# Requirements Document - Team Collaboration App Features

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the team collaboration Android app. The app currently has basic authentication, group management, and task management features. This spec covers the remaining features needed to create a full-featured team collaboration platform with real-time chat, push notifications, file sharing, and enhanced calendar functionality.

The implementation will be done in independent, testable phases where each feature can be run and verified before moving to the next.

## Implementation Priority

The requirements are ordered by priority for implementation:

1. **High Priority (Core Features):**
   - Requirement 1: Real-Time Chat System
   - Requirement 2: Push Notifications
   - Requirement 3: File and Image Sharing

2. **Medium Priority (Enhanced Features):**
   - Requirement 4: Enhanced Calendar View
   - Requirement 5: Profile Picture Management
   - Requirement 6: Message Rich Content

3. **Low Priority (Polish & Optimization):**
   - Requirement 7: Offline Support
   - Requirement 8: User Experience Enhancements
   - Requirement 9: Security and Privacy
   - Requirement 10: Performance Optimization

## Success Criteria

The implementation is considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria for high and medium priority requirements are met
- The app can be run and tested after each requirement is implemented
- Each feature works independently without breaking existing functionality
- The app builds without errors and runs on Android devices (API 23+)
- All features are integrated with Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Cloud Messaging)
- The user can perform end-to-end workflows (create group → chat → share files → receive notifications)

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this implementation:
- Video/audio calling
- Message encryption (end-to-end)
- Multi-language support
- Tablet-optimized layouts
- Wear OS support
- Widget support
