## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Proper Firestore Queries ✅
```kotlin
tasksCollection
    .whereEqualTo("userId", userId)
    .orderBy("dueDate", Query.Direction.ASCENDING)
```
- Uses correct field names
- Supports composite index
- Filters by authenticated user
- Sorts chronologically

### 2. Real-time Updates ✅
```kotlin
fun getUserTasksFlow(): Flow<List<FirebaseTask>> = callbackFlow {
    val listener = tasksCollection
        .whereEqualTo("userId", userId)
        .orderBy("dueDate", Query.Direction.ASCENDING)
        .addSnapshotListener { snapshot, error ->
            // Handle updates
        }
    awaitClose { listener.remove() }
}
```
- Snapshot listener for real-time updates
- Lifecycle-aware collection
- Automatic UI updates

### 3. Accurate Statistics ✅
```kotlin
tasks.forEach { task ->
    when {
        task.status == "completed" -> completed++
        task.dueDate != null && task.dueDate!! < now -> overdue++
        task.dueDate != null && isSameDay(task.dueDate!!, now) -> dueToday++
    }
}
```
- Overdue count (past due, not completed)
- Due today count (due date is today)
- Completed count (status = completed)
- Real-time updates

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling ✅
```kotlin
if (exception is FirebaseFirestoreException &&
    exception.code == FirebaseFirestoreException.Code.FAILED_PRECONDITION) {
    "Database is being configured. This may take a few minutes. Please try again shortly."
}
```
- Specific handling for missing indexes
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry functionality
- Graceful degradation

- Quick reference complete

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Index Creation Time**: When Firestore indexes are first created, they can take several minutes to build. During this time, queries will fail with FAILED_PRECONDITION error. This is expected behavior and the error handling guides users appropriately.

2. **Offline Support**: While Firestore has offline persistence, the current implementation doesn't explicitly handle offline scenarios with custom UI. This could be enhanced in future iterations.

3. **Pagination**: For users with hundreds of tasks, pagination might be needed for better performance. Current implementation loads all user tasks.

---

## Integration Points

### With Other Tasks
- **Task 5 (Dashboard):** Uses same TaskRepository for statistics
- **Task 6 (Groups):** Similar implementation pattern
- **Task 8 (Calendar):** Will use TaskRepository for calendar integration
- **Task 9 (Error Handling):** Already integrated

### With Firebase
- **Firestore:** Queries tasks collection
- **Authentication:** Uses current user ID
- **Security Rules:** Enforces userId filtering
- **Indexes:** Requires composite index (userId, dueDate)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Task 7 is complete - no further action needed
2. ✅ Documentation is complete
3. ✅ Ready for user testing

### Future Enhancements
1. Add pagination for large task lists
2. Implement task search functionality
3. Add more sorting options
4. Implement Kanban view
5. Add task filtering by date range

### Related Tasks to Continue
- **Task 8:** Integrate Tasks with Calendar View
- **Task 9:** Implement Comprehensive Error Handling (partially done)
- **Task 10:** Fix Chat Functionality
- **Task 11:** Optimize Performance
