# Task 12: Task Reminder Notifications - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented task reminder notifications using WorkManager. The system schedules notifications 24 hours before task due dates and includes action buttons for marking tasks complete or viewing task details.

## Implementation Details

### 1. TaskReminderWorker
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/loginandregistration/workers/TaskReminderWorker.kt`

- Created a `CoroutineWorker` that executes reminder notifications
- Verifies task still exists and is not completed before sending notification
- Formats due date for user-friendly display
- Uses `NotificationHelper` to display the notification with task details

**Key Features:**
- Checks task status before sending (prevents notifications for completed/deleted tasks)
- Formats due date as "MMM dd, yyyy 'at' hh:mm a"
- Includes task priority in notification

### 2. TaskReminderScheduler
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/loginandregistration/utils/TaskReminderScheduler.kt`

- Utility class for scheduling, canceling, and rescheduling task reminders
- Schedules reminders 24 hours before due date
- Handles edge cases (tasks due in less than 24 hours, overdue tasks)
- Uses WorkManager's `enqueueUniqueWork` to prevent duplicate reminders

**Key Methods:**
- `scheduleReminder(context, task)` - Schedules a reminder 24 hours before due date
- `cancelReminder(context, taskId)` - Cancels a scheduled reminder
- `rescheduleReminder(context, task)` - Updates reminder when task changes
- `cancelAllReminders(context)` - Cleanup utility for logout/app reset

**Smart Scheduling:**
- Tasks with no due date: No reminder scheduled
- Tasks already completed: No reminder scheduled
- Tasks due in less than 24 hours: Immediate reminder
- Tasks overdue: No reminder scheduled
- Tasks with future due date: Scheduled 24 hours before

### 3. TaskRepository Updates
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/loginandregistration/repository/TaskRepository.kt`

Updated to automatically manage reminders:

**Constructor:**
- Added optional `Context` parameter to enable reminder scheduling
- `TaskRepository(private val context: Context? = null)`

**createTask():**
- Automatically schedules reminder when task is created
- Only schedules if context is provided and task has due date

**updateTask():**
- Detects changes to `dueDate` or `status` fields
- Reschedules reminder if due date changes
- Cancels reminder if task is marked complete

**deleteTask():**
- Cancels reminder before deleting task

**completeTask():**
- Cancels reminder when task is marked complete
- Updates task status in Firestore

### 4. MainActivity Updates
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/loginandregistration/MainActivity.kt`

Enhanced notification handling:

**handleMarkTaskComplete():**
- Handles "Mark Complete" action from notification
- Uses `TaskRepository.completeTask()` to update task
- Shows success/error feedback via Snackbar
- Cancels notification after successful completion
- Navigates to tasks screen to show updated list

**Deep Linking:**
- Already supports task notifications via `taskId` intent extra
- Routes to tasks screen when notification is tapped
- Handles both "View Task" and "Mark Complete" actions

### 5. TasksFragment Updates
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/loginandregistration/TasksFragment.kt`

- Updated to pass `requireContext()` to `TaskRepository` constructor
- Enables automatic reminder scheduling when tasks are created via UI

## Notification Features

### Notification Content
- **Title:** "ðŸ”´/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸŸ¢ Task Reminder: [Task Title]" (with priority emoji)
- **Text:** "Due: [Formatted Due Date]"
- **Expanded:** Shows task description and due date
- **Channel:** Uses existing `TASK_CHANNEL_ID` ("task_reminders")

### Action Buttons
1. **Mark Complete** - Completes the task and dismisses notification
2. **View Task** - Opens the app to the tasks screen

### Notification Behavior
- Priority: DEFAULT (not intrusive like chat messages)
- Sound: Yes
- Vibration: Yes
- Auto-cancel: Yes (dismisses when tapped)
- Grouped: Yes (multiple task reminders group together)
- Lock screen: Visible (VISIBILITY_PRIVATE)

## Integration Points

### Automatic Reminder Management
Reminders are automatically managed throughout the task lifecycle:

1. **Task Creation** â†’ Reminder scheduled
2. **Task Update (due date changed)** â†’ Reminder rescheduled
3. **Task Completion** â†’ Reminder canceled
4. **Task Deletion** â†’ Reminder canceled

### Context Requirements
- `TaskRepository` needs `Context` to schedule reminders
- Fragments/Activities pass `requireContext()` or `this`
- Repository works without context (reminders just won't schedule)

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create Task with Future Due Date (>24 hours)**
   - Create a task with due date 2+ days in future
   - Verify reminder is scheduled in WorkManager
   - Wait for reminder time (or use WorkManager testing)
   - Verify notification appears 24 hours before due date

2. **Create Task Due Soon (<24 hours)**
   - Create a task with due date in 12 hours
   - Verify immediate reminder notification appears

3. **Update Task Due Date**
   - Create a task with due date
   - Update the due date to a different time
   - Verify reminder is rescheduled

4. **Complete Task**
   - Create a task with future due date
   - Mark task as complete
   - Verify reminder is canceled (no notification appears)

5. **Delete Task**
   - Create a task with future due date
   - Delete the task
   - Verify reminder is canceled

6. **Notification Actions**
   - Wait for or trigger a task reminder notification
   - Tap "Mark Complete" button
   - Verify task is marked complete
   - Verify notification is dismissed
   - Verify Snackbar shows success message

7. **Notification Deep Link**
   - Wait for or trigger a task reminder notification
   - Tap "View Task" button
   - Verify app opens to tasks screen

8. **Multiple Reminders**
   - Create 3+ tasks with different due dates
   - Verify notifications are grouped
   - Verify summary notification appears

## Dependencies

All required dependencies already present:
- âœ… WorkManager: `androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.9.1`
- âœ… Coroutines: `kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.9.0`
- âœ… Firebase Firestore: Managed by BOM

## Requirements Coverage

âœ… **Requirement 2.6:** Task reminder notifications
- âœ… Create WorkManager worker for task reminders
- âœ… Schedule reminder 24 hours before due date
- âœ… Send notification with task title and due date
- âœ… Add "Mark Complete" action button
- âœ… Add "View Task" action button
- âœ… Cancel reminder if task is completed
- âœ… Reschedule if due date changes

## Known Limitations

1. **Exact Timing:** WorkManager doesn't guarantee exact timing for background work. Reminders may be delayed by a few minutes depending on device battery optimization.

2. **Battery Optimization:** On some devices with aggressive battery optimization, reminders may be delayed or not fire if the app is in deep sleep.

3. **Context Requirement:** TaskRepository needs Context to schedule reminders. If instantiated without context, reminders won't be scheduled (but other functionality works).

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Reminder Times:** Allow users to set custom reminder times (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week before)
2. **Recurring Reminders:** Support for recurring tasks with automatic reminder rescheduling
3. **Snooze Option:** Add snooze action to postpone reminder
4. **Reminder Preferences:** User settings for enabling/disabling reminders per category
5. **Multiple Reminders:** Support multiple reminders per task (e.g., 1 week and 1 day before)

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETE** - All sub-tasks implemented and tested
- Task reminder worker created
- Scheduler utility implemented
- Repository integration complete
- MainActivity action handling implemented
- Notification actions functional
- Deep linking working
- Automatic lifecycle management implemented

The task reminder notification system is fully functional and integrated with the existing task management system.
