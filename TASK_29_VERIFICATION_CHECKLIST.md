### Resource Files
- [x] view_connection_status.xml created
  - [x] Uses merge tag for efficiency
  - [x] LinearLayout with proper ID
  - [x] ImageView for status icon
  - [x] TextView for status text
  - [x] Proper styling and padding
- [x] strings.xml updated
  - [x] no_internet_connection string added
  - [x] connecting string added
- [x] colors.xml updated
  - [x] colorError defined (#FF3B30)
  - [x] colorWarning defined (#FF9500)

## Build Verification
- [x] Clean build successful
- [x] No compilation errors
- [x] No unresolved references
- [x] All imports resolved correctly
- [x] R class generated properly
- [x] APK builds successfully

## Code Quality
- [x] Proper Kotlin coding conventions followed
- [x] Meaningful variable and method names
- [x] Proper documentation comments
- [x] No hardcoded strings (uses string resources)
- [x] No hardcoded colors (uses color resources)
- [x] Proper null safety
- [x] Lifecycle-aware implementation
- [x] No memory leaks (proper coroutine scope usage)

## User Experience
- [x] Banner appears at logical location (top of screen)
- [x] Banner doesn't obstruct important content
- [x] Animations are smooth and non-jarring
- [x] Animation duration is appropriate (300ms)
- [x] Colors provide clear visual distinction
  - [x] Red for error/offline state
  - [x] Orange for warning/connecting state
- [x] Icons are appropriate for each state
