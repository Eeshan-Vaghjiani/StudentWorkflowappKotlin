## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing (To be performed by user)
- [ ] Test basic HTTPS URL
- [ ] Test HTTP URL
- [ ] Test WWW URL without scheme
- [ ] Test multiple URLs in one message
- [ ] Test URL with path and query parameters
- [ ] Test mixed content (text + URLs)
- [ ] Test in sent messages
- [ ] Test in received messages
- [ ] Test with image messages (caption)
- [ ] Test with document messages (text)

### Visual Testing (To be performed by user)
- [ ] Verify blue color (#2196F3)
- [ ] Verify underline styling
- [ ] Verify no highlight on click
- [ ] Verify consistent styling across messages
- [ ] Verify text layout is correct

### Functional Testing (To be performed by user)
- [ ] Verify browser opens on click
- [ ] Verify correct URL is opened
- [ ] Verify scheme is added to www URLs
- [ ] Verify no crashes on invalid URLs
- [ ] Verify performance is acceptable

## Regression Testing (To be performed by user)

Verify existing features still work:
- [ ] Regular text messages display correctly
- [ ] Image messages work
- [ ] Document messages work
- [ ] Message timestamps display
- [ ] Read receipts work
- [ ] Sender profile pictures display
- [ ] Message grouping works
- [ ] Scroll functionality works
- [ ] Pull to refresh works
- [ ] Message sending works

## Final Sign-off

### ✅ Implementation Complete
- [x] All sub-tasks completed
- [x] All requirements met
- [x] Build successful
- [x] No compilation errors
- [x] Code quality verified
- [x] Documentation complete

### Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

The implementation is complete and ready for manual testing by the user. All code has been written, compiled successfully, and verified against requirements.

## Notes

1. **LinkifyHelper is reusable**: The utility class can be used in other parts of the app if needed (e.g., task descriptions, group descriptions, etc.)

2. **Regex pattern is comprehensive**: The pattern handles most common URL formats, but may need adjustments for very specific edge cases

3. **Performance**: Link detection is performed on the UI thread but should be fast enough for typical message lengths. For very long messages, consider moving to background thread if needed

4. **Customization**: The link color can be customized by passing a color parameter to `makeLinksClickable()`

5. **Browser handling**: The implementation respects the user's default browser preference

6. **Error handling**: Gracefully handles cases where no browser is available or URL is invalid

## Next Task

Task 24: Add message status indicators (clock, checkmarks, error icons)
