## 🔥 Firebase Console Checklist:

Before we proceed, verify in Firebase Console:
- ✅ Authentication is enabled
- ✅ Firestore database is created
- ✅ Storage bucket is created (check Storage tab)
- ✅ Cloud Messaging is enabled (check Cloud Messaging tab)

If Storage or Cloud Messaging are not enabled:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Select your project
3. Enable Storage (Storage → Get Started)
4. Cloud Messaging should be auto-enabled

## 📞 Ready to Continue?

Once your build succeeds, I will immediately start implementing:
1. Chat data models
2. Message data models  
3. ChatRepository
4. Chat UI screens
5. Real-time messaging

The app will transform from a task/group manager into a **full-featured team collaboration platform** with real-time chat, notifications, and file sharing!
