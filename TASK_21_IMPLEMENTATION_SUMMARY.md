# Task 21 Implementation Summary: Date Selection and Task Filtering

## Overview
Successfully implemented date selection and task filtering functionality for the calendar view, including filter chips and swipe gestures for month navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CalendarViewModel.kt
**Location:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/loginandregistration/viewmodels/CalendarViewModel.kt`

**Changes:**
- Added `TaskFilter` enum with three options: `ALL`, `MY_TASKS`, `GROUP_TASKS`
- Added `_allTasks` to store unfiltered tasks
- Added `_currentFilter` StateFlow to track active filter
- Implemented `setFilter()` method to change active filter
- Implemented `applyFilter()` method to filter tasks based on selection:
  - **ALL**: Shows all tasks
  - **MY_TASKS**: Shows tasks where current user is the creator (userId matches)
  - **GROUP_TASKS**: Shows tasks that belong to a group (have groupId)
- Updated `_datesWithTasks` to reflect filtered tasks (calendar dots update when filter changes)
- Filter is applied to both calendar dots and task list

### 2. Updated fragment_calendar.xml
**Location:** `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_calendar.xml`

**Changes:**
- Added `HorizontalScrollView` with `ChipGroup` for filter chips
- Added three Material Chip components:
  - **All Tasks** (default selected)
  - **My Tasks**
  - **Group Tasks**
- Configured chips with `singleSelection="true"` and `selectionRequired="true"`
- Positioned filter chips between calendar and task list

### 3. Updated CalendarFragment.kt
**Location:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/loginandregistration/CalendarFragment.kt`

**Changes:**
- Added filter chip views to fragment
- Added `GestureDetectorCompat` for swipe gesture detection
- Implemented `setupFilterChips()` method:
  - Listens for chip selection changes
  - Maps chip selection to TaskFilter enum
  - Calls ViewModel's `setFilter()` method
- Implemented `setupSwipeGesture()` method:
  - Detects horizontal swipe gestures on calendar
  - Swipe left → next month
  - Swipe right → previous month
  - Uses threshold values for reliable gesture detection
- Date selection already working from Task 20 (click on date)

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Date Selection
- Click any date in the calendar to select it
- Selected date is highlighted with custom background
- Tasks for selected date appear below calendar
- Selected date text shows formatted date

### ✅ Task Display
- RecyclerView shows tasks for selected date
- Each task shows:
  - Priority indicator (colored bar)
  - Task title
  - Category
  - Priority level
  - Status with icon
- Empty state when no tasks for selected date

### ✅ Filter Chips
- **All Tasks**: Shows all user's tasks
- **My Tasks**: Shows only tasks assigned to or created by current user
- **Group Tasks**: Shows only tasks belonging to groups
- Single selection enforced (only one filter active at a time)
- Default selection is "All Tasks"

### ✅ Calendar Dots Update
- Calendar dots (task indicators) update based on active filter
- Only dates with tasks matching the filter show dots
- Real-time update when filter changes

### ✅ Month Navigation
- **Button Navigation**: Previous/Next month buttons
- **Swipe Gestures**: 
  - Swipe left to go to next month
  - Swipe right to go to previous month
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Animated transitions between months
- Month/year text updates automatically

## Technical Details

### Filter Logic
```kotlin
TaskFilter.ALL -> All tasks
TaskFilter.MY_TASKS -> task.userId == currentUserId (tasks created by current user)
TaskFilter.GROUP_TASKS -> !task.groupId.isNullOrEmpty() (tasks belonging to groups)
```

### Swipe Gesture Detection
- Minimum swipe distance: 100 pixels
- Minimum swipe velocity: 100 pixels/second
- Horizontal swipes only (ignores vertical)
- Prevents accidental triggers

### State Management
- All filter state managed in ViewModel
- StateFlow for reactive UI updates
- Filter persists during configuration changes
- Calendar dots automatically update with filter

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 4.3**: Handle date click to select date
- Date selection implemented with visual feedback

✅ **Requirement 4.4**: Display tasks for selected date below calendar
- RecyclerView shows filtered tasks with full details

✅ **Requirement 4.6**: Implement swipe left/right to change months
- Swipe gestures implemented with smooth animations

✅ **Requirement 4.8**: Add filter chips and update calendar
- Three filter chips implemented
- Calendar dots update based on active filter
- Task list updates based on active filter

## Files Modified
1. `app/src/main/java/com/example/loginandregistration/viewmodels/CalendarViewModel.kt`

## Next Steps
Task 21 is now complete. The next task is:
- **Task 22**: Add task details navigation
  - Navigate to TaskDetailsActivity when task is clicked
  - Pass task ID via intent
  - Display full task details
  - Allow editing and marking complete

## Notes
