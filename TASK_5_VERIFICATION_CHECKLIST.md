# Task 5 Verification Checklist

## Pre-Testing Setup
- [ ] Ensure Firebase project is configured
- [ ] Ensure user is logged in
- [ ] Ensure Firestore has some test tasks with various categories
- [ ] Ensure some tasks have due dates for calendar testing

## TaskRepository Verification

### getUserTasks(category) Method
- [ ] Method exists and returns Flow<List<FirebaseTask>>
- [ ] Accepts optional category parameter
- [ ] Filters by category when specified
- [ ] Returns all tasks when category is "all" or null
- [ ] Uses real-time Firestore listener (addSnapshotListener)
- [ ] Properly handles authentication (checks for current user)
- [ ] Orders tasks by dueDate ascending

### getTasksForDate(date) Method
- [ ] Method exists and returns Flow<List<FirebaseTask>>
- [ ] Accepts LocalDate parameter
- [ ] Filters tasks by date range (start to end of day)
- [ ] Uses real-time Firestore listener
- [ ] Properly handles authentication
- [ ] Returns empty list when no tasks for date

### getDatesWithTasks() Method
- [ ] Method exists and returns Flow<Set<LocalDate>>
- [ ] Returns set of all dates that have tasks
- [ ] Uses real-time Firestore listener
- [ ] Properly handles authentication
- [ ] Converts Timestamp to LocalDate correctly

## TasksFragment Verification

### Real-time Updates
- [ ] Fragment uses getUserTasks(category) with Flow collection
- [ ] Uses collectWithLifecycle for proper lifecycle management
- [ ] Tasks update automatically when Firestore data changes
- [ ] No manual refresh needed (though pull-to-refresh works)

### Category Filtering
- [ ] "All Tasks" button shows all tasks
- [ ] "Personal" button shows only personal category tasks
- [ ] "Group" button shows only group category tasks
- [ ] "Assignments" button shows only assignment category tasks
- [ ] Filter updates trigger new Flow collection

### Empty State
- [ ] Empty state view exists in layout (empty_state_layout)
- [ ] Empty state shows when no tasks match filter
- [ ] Empty state text changes based on current filter
- [ ] Empty state hides when tasks are present
- [ ] RecyclerView hides when empty state is shown

### Demo Data Removal
- [ ] getDummyTasks() method is completely removed
- [ ] No hardcoded task data in fragment
- [ ] All tasks come from Firestore

### UI Updates
- [ ] Task stats (overdue, due today, completed) update in real-time
- [ ] Task list updates in real-time
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh works correctly
- [ ] Loading indicator shows during refresh

## CalendarViewModel Verification

### Real-time Listeners
- [ ] setupRealTimeListeners() method exists
- [ ] Collects from getUserTasks(null) Flow
- [ ] Collects from getDatesWithTasks() Flow
- [ ] Runs in viewModelScope
- [ ] Updates _allTasks StateFlow
- [ ] Updates _datesWithTasks StateFlow

### Filter Support
- [ ] ALL filter shows all tasks
- [ ] MY_TASKS filter shows only user's tasks (userId matches)
- [ ] GROUP_TASKS filter shows only tasks with groupId
- [ ] Filter changes update tasksForSelectedDate

### Date Selection
- [ ] selectDate() updates selected date
- [ ] Updates tasksForSelectedDate based on selected date
- [ ] Tasks filtered by both date and current filter

## CalendarFragment Verification

### Calendar Display
- [ ] Calendar view displays correctly
- [ ] Month/year header shows current month
- [ ] Previous/next month buttons work
- [ ] Swipe gestures work for month navigation

### Dot Indicators
- [ ] Dots appear on dates that have tasks
- [ ] Dots update when tasks are added/removed
- [ ] Dots respect current filter (All/My/Group)
- [ ] No dots on dates without tasks

### Task List for Selected Date
- [ ] Selecting a date shows tasks for that date
- [ ] Task list updates when date changes
- [ ] Task list respects current filter
- [ ] Task list shows correct task details

### Empty State
- [ ] Empty state shows when no tasks for selected date
- [ ] Empty state message is appropriate
- [ ] Empty state hides when tasks are present
- [ ] RecyclerView hides when empty state is shown

### Filter Chips
- [ ] "All Tasks" chip shows all tasks
- [ ] "My Tasks" chip shows only user's tasks
- [ ] "Group Tasks" chip shows only group tasks
- [ ] Filter changes update both dots and task list

## Integration Testing

### Real-time Updates
- [ ] Create a new task â†’ appears immediately in Tasks screen
- [ ] Create a new task â†’ dot appears on calendar date
- [ ] Update task due date â†’ calendar updates immediately
- [ ] Delete a task â†’ disappears from Tasks screen
- [ ] Delete a task â†’ dot removed from calendar if no other tasks
- [ ] Complete a task â†’ status updates in real-time

### Cross-Screen Consistency
- [ ] Task created in Tasks screen appears in Calendar
- [ ] Task updated in one screen reflects in other
- [ ] Filter changes work independently in each screen
- [ ] Navigation between screens maintains data consistency

### Category Filtering
- [ ] Create personal task â†’ appears in "Personal" filter
- [ ] Create group task â†’ appears in "Group" filter
- [ ] Create assignment â†’ appears in "Assignments" filter
- [ ] All tasks appear in "All Tasks" filter

### Multi-User Testing (if possible)
- [ ] User A creates task â†’ User B sees it (if in same group)
- [ ] User A updates task â†’ User B sees update
- [ ] User A deletes task â†’ User B sees deletion

## Edge Cases

### No Data Scenarios
- [ ] New user with no tasks sees empty state
- [ ] Filtering to category with no tasks shows empty state
- [ ] Selecting date with no tasks shows empty state
- [ ] Empty state messages are user-friendly

### Network Scenarios
- [ ] Offline mode shows cached data
- [ ] Coming back online syncs changes
- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully
- [ ] No crashes on network issues

### Date/Time Scenarios
- [ ] Tasks with past due dates appear correctly
- [ ] Tasks with future due dates appear correctly
- [ ] Tasks with today's date appear correctly
- [ ] Tasks without due dates don't appear in calendar

### Authentication Scenarios
- [ ] Only user's own tasks are shown
- [ ] Logging out clears task data
- [ ] Logging in loads correct user's tasks
- [ ] No data leakage between users

## Performance Testing

### Load Time
- [ ] Tasks screen loads quickly (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] Calendar screen loads quickly (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] Filter changes are instant
- [ ] Date selection is instant

### Memory
- [ ] No memory leaks when navigating away
- [ ] Listeners properly cleaned up on Fragment destroy
- [ ] No excessive memory usage with many tasks

### Battery
- [ ] Real-time listeners don't drain battery excessively
- [ ] Listeners pause when app is in background
- [ ] Listeners resume when app comes to foreground

## UI/UX Testing

### Visual Consistency
- [ ] Empty state icons display correctly (ðŸ“‹, ðŸ“…)
- [ ] Task cards display correctly
- [ ] Calendar dots are visible and clear
- [ ] Loading indicators show during operations

### User Feedback
- [ ] Toast messages show for filter changes
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh provides visual feedback
- [ ] Loading states are clear
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

### Accessibility
- [ ] Content descriptions present on buttons
- [ ] Text is readable (size, contrast)
- [ ] Touch targets are adequate size
- [ ] Screen reader compatible

## Code Quality

### Architecture
- [ ] Follows MVVM pattern
- [ ] Repository pattern used correctly
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] No business logic in UI layer

### Best Practices
- [ ] Uses Kotlin Flow for reactive data
- [ ] Lifecycle-aware components
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No hardcoded strings (uses resources)

### Code Cleanliness
- [ ] No unused imports
- [ ] No unused variables
- [ ] Proper naming conventions
- [ ] Comments where needed

## Notes
Use this checklist to systematically verify all aspects of Task 5 implementation. Check off items as you verify them. Any issues found should be documented and fixed before marking the task as complete.
