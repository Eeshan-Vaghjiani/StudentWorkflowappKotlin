# Task 5 Verification Checklist

## Pre-Verification Setup
- [ ] Ensure Firestore rules are deployed (Task 1)
- [ ] Ensure Firestore indexes are created (Task 1)
- [ ] Ensure you have test data in Firestore:
  - [ ] At least 2-3 tasks with different statuses
  - [ ] At least 1-2 groups where you're a member
  - [ ] User profile with aiUsageCount field

## Verification Steps

### 1. DashboardStats Data Class
- [ ] File exists at `app/src/main/java/com/example/loginandregistration/models/DashboardStats.kt`
- [ ] Contains all required fields:
  - [ ] totalTasks, completedTasks, pendingTasks, overdueTasks, tasksDue
  - [ ] activeGroups
  - [ ] aiUsageCount, aiUsageLimit
  - [ ] totalSessions
  - [ ] isLoading, error
- [ ] Helper methods work:
  - [ ] `getAIUsageProgress()` returns correct percentage
  - [ ] `getRemainingAIPrompts()` returns correct value
  - [ ] `hasError()` returns true when error is not null
  - [ ] `isSuccess()` returns true when not loading and no error

### 2. Task Statistics (Real-time)
- [ ] Open Home screen
- [ ] Verify task count displays (not "..." or "0" if you have tasks)
- [ ] Create a new task in Tasks screen
- [ ] Return to Home screen
- [ ] Verify task count increased immediately (no refresh needed)
- [ ] Mark a task as completed
- [ ] Verify completed count updates immediately
- [ ] Create an overdue task (due date in past)
- [ ] Verify "tasks due" count includes overdue tasks

### 3. Group Statistics (Real-time)
- [ ] Open Home screen
- [ ] Verify group count displays (not "..." or "0" if you have groups)
- [ ] Join or create a new group
- [ ] Return to Home screen
- [ ] Verify group count increased immediately (no refresh needed)
- [ ] Leave a group
- [ ] Verify group count decreased immediately

### 4. AI Usage Statistics (Real-time)
- [ ] Open Home screen
- [ ] Verify AI usage displays:
  - [ ] "X prompts left" text
  - [ ] Progress bar shows usage
  - [ ] "X/10 used" text
- [ ] Use AI assistant (if implemented)
- [ ] Return to Home screen
- [ ] Verify AI usage count increased
- [ ] Verify remaining prompts decreased
- [ ] Verify progress bar updated

### 5. Loading States
- [ ] Clear app data or use fresh install
- [ ] Open Home screen
- [ ] Verify loading indicators appear:
  - [ ] Task count shows "..."
  - [ ] Group count shows "..."
  - [ ] Session count shows "..."
  - [ ] AI usage shows "..."
  - [ ] AI usage details shows "Loading..."
- [ ] Wait for data to load
- [ ] Verify loading indicators disappear
- [ ] Verify real data appears

### 6. Error States
- [ ] Turn off internet connection
- [ ] Open Home screen (or pull to refresh)
- [ ] Verify error handling:
  - [ ] Toast message appears with error
  - [ ] All counts show "0" as fallback
  - [ ] AI usage shows default values (0/10)
  - [ ] Message suggests "Pull down to refresh"
- [ ] Turn on internet connection
- [ ] Pull down to refresh (if SwipeRefreshLayout implemented)
- [ ] Verify data loads successfully

### 7. No Demo Data
- [ ] Search HomeFragment.kt for:
  - [ ] No hardcoded numbers (except default limit of 10 for AI)
  - [ ] No "demo" or "placeholder" data
  - [ ] All data comes from Firestore queries
- [ ] Verify in running app:
  - [ ] Task count matches actual Firestore data
  - [ ] Group count matches actual Firestore data
  - [ ] AI usage matches actual user document

### 8. Lifecycle Management
- [ ] Open Home screen
- [ ] Navigate away to another screen
- [ ] Navigate back to Home screen
- [ ] Verify data loads correctly
- [ ] Rotate device (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify data persists and updates continue
- [ ] Check logcat for memory leaks or crashes
- [ ] Verify no "leaked window" errors

### 9. Real-time Updates (Multi-device)
If you have access to two devices or emulators:
- [ ] Login with same account on both devices
- [ ] Open Home screen on both
- [ ] On device 1: Create a new task
- [ ] On device 2: Verify task count updates immediately
- [ ] On device 1: Join a new group
- [ ] On device 2: Verify group count updates immediately
- [ ] On device 1: Use AI assistant
- [ ] On device 2: Verify AI usage updates immediately

### 10. Edge Cases
- [ ] New user with no data:
  - [ ] All counts show "0"
  - [ ] No error messages
  - [ ] UI looks clean
- [ ] User with only completed tasks:
  - [ ] "Tasks due" shows "0"
  - [ ] Total tasks shows correct count
- [ ] User with no groups:
  - [ ] Group count shows "0"
  - [ ] No error messages
- [ ] User at AI usage limit:
  - [ ] Shows "0 prompts left"
  - [ ] Progress bar at 100%
  - [ ] Shows "10/10 used"

## Code Quality Checks
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] No warnings in getDiagnostics
- [ ] Proper imports (Timestamp, Flow, catch, etc.)
- [ ] KDoc comments on all methods
- [ ] Proper error handling with try-catch
- [ ] Flow error handling with .catch {}
- [ ] Proper coroutine lifecycle management
- [ ] No memory leaks (statsJob cancelled in onDestroyView)

## Logcat Verification
Check logcat for:
- [ ] "Showing loading state" appears on load
- [ ] "Received X tasks from Firestore" appears
- [ ] "Received X groups from Firestore" appears
- [ ] "Received user profile with AI usage: X" appears
- [ ] "Updating task stats UI: due=X, total=X..." appears
- [ ] "Updating group stats UI: activeGroups=X" appears
- [ ] "Updating AI stats UI: used=X, limit=X" appears
- [ ] No error messages (unless testing error states)
- [ ] No "PERMISSION_DENIED" errors
- [ ] No "FAILED_PRECONDITION" errors

## Performance Checks
- [ ] Dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] No UI freezing or lag
- [ ] Smooth scrolling
- [ ] Real-time updates appear within 1 second
- [ ] No excessive Firestore reads (check Firebase Console)
- [ ] Listeners properly cleaned up (check Firebase Console connections)
