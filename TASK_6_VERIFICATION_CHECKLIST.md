## Quick Test Script

For rapid verification, run this minimal test:

1. **Create Group Test** (30 seconds)
   - Open Groups screen
   - Click "Create Group"
   - Enter "Test Group" as name
   - Click Create
   - ‚úÖ Group appears immediately

2. **Real-time Test** (1 minute)
   - Open app on two devices
   - Create group on Device A
   - ‚úÖ Appears on Device B within 2 seconds

3. **Error Test** (30 seconds)
   - Deny Firestore rules
   - Open Groups screen
   - ‚úÖ User-friendly error message shown

**Total Time: 2 minutes**

If all three tests pass, Task 6 is working correctly! ‚úÖ
