# Task 21 Testing Guide: Date Selection and Task Filtering

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Ensure Test Data Exists
Before testing, make sure you have:
- At least 3-5 tasks with different due dates
- Some tasks assigned to you (My Tasks)
- Some tasks in groups (Group Tasks)
- Some tasks on different dates this month
- Some tasks on dates in next/previous months

### 2. Build and Install
```bash
./gradlew clean assembleDebug
./gradlew installDebug
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Date Selection
**Objective**: Verify date selection works correctly

**Steps:**
1. Open the app and navigate to Calendar tab
2. Observe the calendar view
3. Click on today's date
   - âœ… Date should be highlighted with colored background
   - âœ… "Tasks for [date]" text should appear below calendar
   - âœ… Tasks for today should appear in list (or empty state)
4. Click on a different date with tasks
   - âœ… Previous date should unhighlight
   - âœ… New date should highlight
   - âœ… Task list should update to show tasks for new date
5. Click on a date without tasks
   - âœ… Empty state should appear: "ðŸ“… No tasks for this date"

**Expected Results:**
- Only one date highlighted at a time
- Task list updates immediately when date changes
- Selected date text shows correct formatted date
- Empty state appears when no tasks exist

---

### Scenario 2: Filter - All Tasks
**Objective**: Verify "All Tasks" filter shows all tasks

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Calendar tab
2. Ensure "All Tasks" chip is selected (should be default)
3. Observe calendar dots
   - âœ… Dots should appear on all dates that have any tasks
4. Click on a date with tasks
   - âœ… All tasks for that date should appear
5. Count the number of dates with dots
6. Note the total number of tasks shown

**Expected Results:**
- All tasks visible regardless of assignment or group
- Calendar dots on all dates with tasks
- This is the baseline for comparing other filters

---

### Scenario 3: Filter - My Tasks
**Objective**: Verify "My Tasks" filter shows only assigned/created tasks

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Calendar tab
2. Click "My Tasks" chip
   - âœ… Chip should become selected (highlighted)
   - âœ… "All Tasks" chip should deselect
3. Observe calendar dots
   - âœ… Dots should only appear on dates with tasks assigned to you
   - âœ… Some dots may disappear compared to "All Tasks"
4. Click on a date with dots
   - âœ… Only tasks created by you should appear
5. Click on a date that had dots in "All Tasks" but not in "My Tasks"
   - âœ… Empty state should appear

**Expected Results:**
- Only tasks where you are the creator (userId matches current user)
- Calendar dots update to reflect filtered tasks
- Task count should be equal or less than "All Tasks"

---

### Scenario 4: Filter - Group Tasks
**Objective**: Verify "Group Tasks" filter shows only group-related tasks

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Calendar tab
2. Click "Group Tasks" chip
   - âœ… Chip should become selected
   - âœ… Previous chip should deselect
3. Observe calendar dots
   - âœ… Dots should only appear on dates with group tasks
4. Click on a date with dots
   - âœ… Only tasks with a groupId should appear
   - âœ… Task category should show "Group" or similar
5. Verify personal tasks don't appear
   - âœ… Tasks with category "Personal" should not be visible

**Expected Results:**
- Only tasks belonging to groups (have groupId)
- Calendar dots update accordingly
- Personal tasks are filtered out

---

### Scenario 5: Month Navigation - Buttons
**Objective**: Verify month navigation buttons work

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Calendar tab
2. Note the current month/year displayed
3. Click "Previous Month" button (left arrow)
   - âœ… Calendar should scroll to previous month
   - âœ… Month/year text should update
   - âœ… Animation should be smooth
4. Click "Next Month" button (right arrow) twice
   - âœ… Calendar should scroll forward two months
   - âœ… Month/year text should update each time
5. Navigate back to current month
   - âœ… Today's date should be visible and highlighted differently

**Expected Results:**
- Smooth scrolling animation between months
- Month/year text always matches displayed month
- Can navigate multiple months in either direction

---

### Scenario 6: Month Navigation - Swipe Gestures
**Objective**: Verify swipe gestures change months

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Calendar tab
2. Place finger on calendar and swipe LEFT (towards left edge)
   - âœ… Calendar should scroll to NEXT month
   - âœ… Month/year text should update
3. Swipe RIGHT (towards right edge)
   - âœ… Calendar should scroll to PREVIOUS month
   - âœ… Month/year text should update
4. Try a short swipe (less than 100 pixels)
   - âœ… Should NOT change month (threshold not met)
5. Try a slow swipe
   - âœ… Should NOT change month (velocity too low)
6. Try a vertical swipe
   - âœ… Should NOT change month (wrong direction)

**Expected Results:**
- Swipe left = next month
- Swipe right = previous month
- Short/slow swipes ignored
- Vertical swipes ignored
- Smooth animation

---

### Scenario 7: Filter Persistence
**Objective**: Verify filter selection persists

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Calendar tab
2. Select "My Tasks" filter
3. Select a specific date
4. Navigate to a different tab (e.g., Tasks or Groups)
5. Navigate back to Calendar tab
   - âœ… "My Tasks" filter should still be selected
   - âœ… Same date should still be selected
   - âœ… Task list should show same filtered tasks

**Expected Results:**
- Filter selection survives tab changes
- Selected date survives tab changes
- ViewModel maintains state

---

### Scenario 8: Real-time Updates
**Objective**: Verify calendar updates when tasks change

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Calendar tab
2. Select "All Tasks" filter
3. Note a date without any dots
4. Navigate to Tasks tab
5. Create a new task with due date = the date without dots
6. Navigate back to Calendar tab
   - âœ… The date should now have a dot
7. Click on that date
   - âœ… The new task should appear in the list

**Expected Results:**
- Calendar dots update when tasks are added
- Task list updates with new tasks
- Changes reflect immediately

---

### Scenario 9: Edge Cases
**Objective**: Test edge cases and error conditions

**Steps:**
1. **No Tasks at All**
   - Delete all tasks or use a new account
   - Navigate to Calendar tab
   - âœ… No dots should appear on any date
   - âœ… Empty state should show for any selected date

2. **Many Tasks on One Date**
   - Create 10+ tasks for the same date
   - Navigate to Calendar tab
   - Click on that date
   - âœ… All tasks should appear in scrollable list
   - âœ… Only one dot should appear (not multiple)

3. **Tasks Spanning Multiple Months**
   - Create tasks in previous, current, and next month
   - Navigate between months
   - âœ… Each month should show correct dots
   - âœ… Filter should work across all months

4. **Rapid Filter Changes**
   - Quickly click between all three filter chips
   - âœ… UI should update smoothly without crashes
   - âœ… No flickering or incorrect data

**Expected Results:**
- App handles edge cases gracefully
- No crashes or errors
- UI remains responsive

## Bug Reporting Template

If you find issues, report using this format:

```
**Bug Title:** [Brief description]

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. 
2. 
3. 

**Expected Behavior:**
[What should happen]

**Actual Behavior:**
[What actually happens]

**Filter Active:** [All Tasks / My Tasks / Group Tasks]

**Date Selected:** [Date]

**Screenshots:** [If applicable]

**Device:** [Device model and Android version]
```

---

## Success Criteria

Task 21 is considered complete when:

âœ… Date selection works correctly
âœ… All three filters work as expected
âœ… Calendar dots update based on active filter
âœ… Task list updates based on filter and selected date
âœ… Month navigation works via buttons
âœ… Month navigation works via swipe gestures
âœ… Filter selection persists during navigation
âœ… No crashes or errors
âœ… UI is responsive and smooth
âœ… Empty states display correctly

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Filter Persistence**: Filter resets to "All Tasks" when app is closed and reopened (by design)
2. **Swipe Sensitivity**: Swipe gestures may not work if you start the swipe on a date cell (date click takes priority)
3. **Task Details**: Clicking a task doesn't navigate to details yet (Task 22)

---

## Next Steps After Testing

If all tests pass:
1. Mark Task 21 as complete
2. Update tasks.md
3. Proceed to Task 22: Add task details navigation

If tests fail:
1. Document the failures
2. Fix the issues
3. Re-test
4. Update implementation summary
