# Task 7: Tasks Display Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the Tasks display functionality with proper query support, error handling, and statistics.

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Firebase Setup
- âœ… Firestore security rules deployed
- âœ… Firestore indexes created (userId, dueDate composite index)
- âœ… Firebase Authentication enabled
- âœ… User account created and logged in

### 2. Test Data Setup
Create test tasks with various scenarios:
- Tasks with different due dates (past, today, future)
- Tasks with different statuses (pending, completed)
- Tasks with different categories (personal, group, assignment)
- Tasks with different priorities (low, medium, high)

---

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Task Display

**Objective:** Verify tasks load and display correctly

**Steps:**
1. Open the app and navigate to Tasks screen
2. Observe the task list

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Tasks load without errors
- âœ… Tasks are displayed in a list
- âœ… Each task shows: title, subject, due date, status
- âœ… Tasks are sorted by due date (earliest first)
- âœ… Loading indicator appears briefly during load

**Pass Criteria:**
- All tasks visible
- No error messages
- Correct sorting order

---

### Test 2: Task Statistics Display

**Objective:** Verify task statistics are calculated correctly

**Steps:**

2. Observe the statistics card at the top
3. Count tasks manually:
   - Overdue tasks (past due date, not completed)
   - Due today tasks (due date is today)
   - Completed tasks (status = completed)

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… "Overdue" count matches actual overdue tasks
- âœ… "Due Today" count matches tasks due today
- âœ… "Completed" count matches completed tasks
- âœ… Statistics update in real-time

**Pass Criteria:**
- All counts are accurate
- Statistics match manual count

**Test Data Example:**
```
Task 1: Due yesterday, status=pending â†’ Overdue
Task 2: Due today, status=pending â†’ Due Today
Task 3: Due tomorrow, status=pending â†’ Neither
Task 4: Due yesterday, status=completed â†’ Completed
Task 5: Due today, status=completed â†’ Completed
