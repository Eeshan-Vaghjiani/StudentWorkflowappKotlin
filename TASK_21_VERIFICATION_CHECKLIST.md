- [ ] Chips are horizontally scrollable if needed
- [ ] Calendar dots are visible
- [ ] Selected date has distinct background
- [ ] Task list items are properly formatted
- [ ] Empty state is centered and clear

### Interactions

- [ ] Button navigation still works
- [ ] No UI lag or stuttering
- [ ] Animations are smooth

### Responsiveness
- [ ] Filter changes update UI immediately
- [ ] Date selection updates UI immediately
- [ ] Month navigation is smooth
- [ ] No loading delays
- [ ] Scrolling is smooth

---

## ✅ Integration Testing

### With Existing Features
- [ ] Task 20 calendar display still works
- [ ] Calendar dots still appear correctly
- [ ] Today's date is still highlighted
- [ ] Month header still shows day names
- [ ] Task creation updates calendar
- [ ] Task deletion updates calendar

### Cross-Tab Navigation
- [ ] Filter selection persists when switching tabs
- [ ] Selected date persists when switching tabs
- [ ] Calendar state is maintained
- [ ] No data loss during navigation

### Data Consistency
- [ ] All Tasks filter shows all tasks
- [ ] My Tasks filter shows only user's created tasks
- [ ] Group Tasks filter shows correct subset
- [ ] Calendar dots match filtered tasks
- [ ] Task counts are accurate

---

## ✅ Edge Cases

### No Data Scenarios
- [ ] No tasks at all - empty state appears
- [ ] No tasks for selected date - empty state appears
- [ ] No tasks matching filter - calendar has no dots
- [ ] New user with no data - app doesn't crash

### Many Tasks Scenarios
- [ ] 10+ tasks on one date - all display correctly
- [ ] 50+ tasks total - calendar loads quickly
- [ ] Multiple tasks on many dates - dots appear correctly

### Filter Edge Cases
- [ ] User has not created any tasks - My Tasks shows empty
- [ ] No group tasks - Group Tasks shows empty
- [ ] All tasks are group tasks - filters work correctly
- [ ] Rapid filter switching - no crashes

### Navigation Edge Cases
- [ ] Navigate to first month in range - no crash
- [ ] Navigate to last month in range - no crash
- [ ] Swipe rapidly multiple times - smooth operation
- [ ] Click buttons rapidly - smooth operation

---

## ✅ Performance Checks
