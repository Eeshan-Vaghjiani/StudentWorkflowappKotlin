---

### Test 3: Reconnecting
**Objective**: Verify the connecting state when internet is restored

**Steps**:
1. Start with app in offline state (banner visible)
2. Disable airplane mode or re-enable WiFi/mobile data
3. Observe the banner

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner changes to orange color
- ✅ Icon changes to sync icon
- ✅ Message changes to "Connecting..."
- ✅ Banner displays for approximately 1.5 seconds
- ✅ Banner then slides up and disappears
- ✅ Animation is smooth

### Test 4: Banner in MainActivity
**Objective**: Verify banner works across all fragments in MainActivity

**Steps**:
1. Launch app with internet connection
2. Navigate to each tab: Home, Groups, Tasks, Calendar, Chat
3. Enable airplane mode
4. Observe banner on each screen
5. Disable airplane mode
6. Observe banner disappearing on each screen

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner appears consistently across all fragments
- ✅ Banner is positioned at the top, below the status bar
- ✅ Banner doesn't overlap with fragment content
- ✅ Fragment content adjusts properly when banner appears/disappears

---

### Test 5: Banner in ChatRoomActivity
**Objective**: Verify banner works in chat room screen

**Steps**:
1. Open a chat conversation
2. Enable airplane mode
3. Observe the banner
4. Try to send a message (should queue)
5. Disable airplane mode
6. Observe banner and message sending

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner appears at top of chat room
- ✅ Banner doesn't overlap with toolbar or messages
- ✅ Messages are queued when offline
- ✅ Banner shows "Connecting..." when back online
- ✅ Queued messages send after reconnection
- ✅ Banner disappears after connection is stable

---

### Test 6: Rapid Connection Changes
**Objective**: Verify banner handles rapid connectivity changes gracefully

**Steps**:
1. Launch app
2. Quickly toggle airplane mode on and off multiple times
3. Observe banner behavior

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner doesn't flicker or show multiple instances
- ✅ Animations don't overlap or cause visual glitches
- ✅ Final state matches actual connectivity status
- ✅ No app crashes or freezes

---

### Test 7: Banner Elevation and Visibility
**Objective**: Verify banner is clearly visible and properly elevated

**Steps**:
1. Enable airplane mode
2. Observe banner appearance
3. Check if banner is visible over all content
4. Check shadow/elevation effect

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner has visible elevation/shadow
- ✅ Banner appears above all other content
- ✅ Text and icon are clearly readable
- ✅ Colors provide good contrast (red for offline, orange for connecting)

---

### Test 8: Long-term Offline State
**Objective**: Verify banner remains stable during extended offline period

**Steps**:
1. Enable airplane mode
2. Use the app for 5-10 minutes while offline
3. Navigate between different screens
4. Observe banner behavior

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner remains visible throughout offline period
- ✅ Banner doesn't disappear unexpectedly
- ✅ Banner doesn't cause memory leaks or performance issues
- ✅ App remains responsive

---

### Test 9: Orientation Change
**Objective**: Verify banner handles screen rotation correctly

**Steps**:
1. Enable airplane mode (banner visible)
2. Rotate device from portrait to landscape
3. Rotate back to portrait
4. Disable airplane mode
5. Observe banner during rotations

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner remains visible after rotation
- ✅ Banner width adjusts to screen width
- ✅ Banner doesn't cause layout issues
- ✅ Banner state is preserved across rotations

---

### Test 10: Background and Foreground
**Objective**: Verify banner updates when app returns from background

**Steps**:
1. Launch app with internet connection
2. Press home button (app goes to background)
3. Enable airplane mode
4. Return to app
5. Observe banner

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner appears when app detects offline state
- ✅ Connection monitor resumes properly
- ✅ Banner state reflects current connectivity

---

## Edge Cases to Test

### Edge Case 1: Slow Network
**Steps**:
1. Connect to a very slow WiFi network
2. Observe banner behavior

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner shows appropriate state based on actual connectivity
- ✅ No false positives (showing offline when connected)

### Edge Case 2: WiFi Without Internet
**Steps**:
1. Connect to WiFi network without internet access
2. Observe banner

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner shows offline state (no internet capability)
- ✅ ConnectionMonitor correctly detects lack of internet

### Edge Case 3: Switching Networks
**Steps**:
1. Switch from WiFi to mobile data
2. Switch from mobile data to WiFi
3. Observe banner during transitions

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Banner may briefly show "Connecting..." during switch
- ✅ Banner disappears once new connection is stable
- ✅ No prolonged offline state during network switch

## Performance Testing

### Memory Usage
**Steps**:
1. Use Android Profiler to monitor memory
2. Toggle connection on/off multiple times
3. Check for memory leaks

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ No memory leaks from animation or listeners
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable

### Animation Performance
**Steps**:
1. Enable "Show layout bounds" in Developer Options
2. Observe banner animations
3. Check for layout thrashing

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Smooth 60fps animations
- ✅ No unnecessary layout recalculations
- ✅ Minimal impact on app performance
