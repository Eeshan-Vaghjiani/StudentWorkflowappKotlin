### Code Regeneration

3. Old code becomes **invalid immediately**
4. New code is generated
5. Share the new code with trusted members

### Member Limits
- Maximum 50 members per group
- Code won't work if group is full
- Owner can remove inactive members to make space

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid join code"
**Possible causes:**
- Code was typed incorrectly
- Code was regenerated by owner
- Group was deleted
- Code is from an inactive group

**Solutions:**
- Double-check the code
- Ask owner for current code
- Make sure code is uppercase
- Try copying/pasting instead of typing

### "Group is full"
**Cause:** Group has reached 50 member limit

**Solutions:**
- Ask owner to remove inactive members
- Owner can increase limit (if implemented)
- Create a new group

### "You are already a member"
**Cause:** You've already joined this group

**Solution:**
- Check your groups list
- The group should already be there

### Can't see "Join Group" button
**Possible causes:**
- Not logged in
- App needs update
- UI issue

**Solutions:**
- Restart the app
- Check you're logged in
- Look in Quick Actions section

## Best Practices

### For Group Owners
1. **Keep codes private** - Only share with people you want in the group
2. **Regenerate regularly** - If code is shared publicly
3. **Use multiple methods** - Email for formal, WhatsApp for quick
4. **Include context** - Tell people what the group is for
5. **Set expectations** - Let members know group rules

### For Members
1. **Save the code** - In case you need to rejoin
2. **Don't share** - Unless owner says it's okay
3. **Join promptly** - Codes might be regenerated
4. **Verify group** - Make sure it's the right group before joining
