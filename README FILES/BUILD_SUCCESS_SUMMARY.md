# ‚úÖ Build Success Summary

## Status: BUILD SUCCESSFUL! üéâ

The app has been successfully built with the new TeamSync package name.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Package Name Mismatch ‚úÖ
**Problem**: `google-services.json` didn't have the TeamSync package name  
**Solution**: You added the TeamSync app to Firebase and downloaded new `google-services.json`  
**Result**: Package name `com.teamsync.collaboration` now recognized by Firebase

### 2. Missing Splash Screen Library ‚úÖ
**Problem**: `Theme.SplashScreen` parent not found  
**Solution**: Added `androidx.core:core-splashscreen:1.0.1` dependency  
**Result**: Splash screen theme now works properly

### 3. Missing Color Resource ‚úÖ
**Problem**: `color/primary_blue` not found  
**Solution**: Changed to `color/colorPrimaryBlue` (the actual color name in colors.xml)  
**Files Updated**:
- `app/src/main/res/values/splash_theme.xml`
- `app/src/main/res/drawable/splash_background.xml`
