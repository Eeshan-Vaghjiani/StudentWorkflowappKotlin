## Functional Testing Checklist

### Real-time Updates
- [ ] Open dashboard → Stats load from Firestore
- [ ] Create a task in Firestore → Dashboard updates immediately
- [ ] Complete a task → Task stats update in real-time
- [ ] Join a group → Group count increments
- [ ] Leave a group → Group count decrements
- [ ] Create a session → Session count updates
- [ ] Update AI usage in user document → Progress bar updates

### Loading States
- [ ] Dashboard shows "..." while loading
- [ ] AI usage shows "Loading..." initially
- [ ] Progress bar starts at 0
- [ ] Smooth transition from loading to data

### Error Handling
- [ ] Disconnect network → Shows "0" values
- [ ] Reconnect network → Resumes real-time updates
- [ ] Invalid user → Shows default values
- [ ] Firestore error → Doesn't crash app

### Empty States
- [ ] New user with no data → Appropriate display
- [ ] User with no tasks → Task count shows "0"
- [ ] User with no groups → Group count shows "0"
- [ ] User with no sessions → Session count shows "0"

### Data Accuracy
- [ ] Task count matches Firestore data
- [ ] Group count matches Firestore data
- [ ] Session count matches Firestore data
- [ ] AI usage matches user document
- [ ] Overdue tasks calculated correctly
- [ ] Today's sessions calculated correctly

### Performance
- [ ] Dashboard loads quickly
- [ ] No lag when data updates
- [ ] Listeners properly cleaned up on fragment destroy
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Multiple rapid updates handled smoothly

## Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: Initial Load
1. Clear app data
2. Login with test account
3. Navigate to dashboard
4. Verify loading indicators appear
5. Verify data loads from Firestore
6. Verify all stats display correctly

### Test 2: Real-time Task Updates
1. Open dashboard
2. In Firestore console, create a new task for the user
3. Verify task count updates immediately
4. Mark task as completed in Firestore
5. Verify completed count updates

### Test 3: Real-time Group Updates
1. Open dashboard
2. In Firestore console, add user to a new group
3. Verify group count increments
4. Remove user from group
5. Verify group count decrements

### Test 4: AI Usage Updates
1. Open dashboard
2. Note current AI usage
3. In Firestore console, update user's `aiPromptsUsed`
4. Verify progress bar updates
5. Verify remaining prompts updates

### Test 5: Network Error Handling
1. Open dashboard with network connected
2. Verify data loads
3. Disable network
4. Verify app doesn't crash
5. Re-enable network
6. Verify data resumes updating

### Test 6: Empty State
1. Create new test user
2. Login with new user
3. Navigate to dashboard
4. Verify all counts show "0"
5. Create first task
6. Verify task count updates to "1"

### Test 7: Multiple Users
1. Login with User A
2. Open dashboard
3. Login with User B on another device
4. Add User A to a group
5. Verify User A's dashboard updates

## Expected Results

### Task Stats
- Total: Count of all user's tasks
- Completed: Count of completed tasks
- Pending: Count of pending tasks
- Overdue: Count of tasks past due date and not completed
- Tasks Due: Overdue + Pending

### Group Count
- Count of groups where user is in `memberIds` array
- Only counts groups with `isActive = true`

### Session Stats
- Total Sessions: All sessions for user
- Total Minutes: Sum of all session durations
- Today's Sessions: Sessions with startTime >= today's start

### AI Usage
- Used: Value from user document `aiPromptsUsed`
- Limit: Value from user document `aiPromptsLimit` (default 10)
- Progress: (used / limit) * 100
- Remaining: limit - used

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Notes
- All data now comes from Firestore
- No demo data is used
- Real-time updates work via snapshot listeners
- Proper error handling prevents crashes
- Loading states improve UX
- Empty state foundation is in place

## Sign-off
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] All tests passed
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Ready for next task
