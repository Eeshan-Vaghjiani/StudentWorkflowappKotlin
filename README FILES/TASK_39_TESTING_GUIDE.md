```
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: methodName
```
**Solution**: Keep the method in ProGuard rules

#### Serialization Errors
```
com.google.firebase.firestore.FirebaseFirestoreException: Could not deserialize object
```
**Solution**: Keep data class fields

#### Reflection Errors
```
java.lang.IllegalAccessException: Class not accessible
```
**Solution**: Keep reflection attributes

adb shell pm clear com.example.loginandregistration

# Force stop app
adb shell am force-stop com.example.loginandregistration

# Start app
adb shell am start -n com.example.loginandregistration/.Login

# Take screenshot
adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screenshot.png
adb pull /sdcard/screenshot.png

```

### ProGuard Mapping File
Location: `app/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt`

Use this file to deobfuscate stack traces:
```bash
retrace.bat mapping.txt stacktrace.txt
```

## Conclusion

This testing guide ensures comprehensive verification of the ProGuard-enabled release build. Follow all steps carefully and document any issues found. The goal is to ensure the release build works identically to the debug build while benefiting from code obfuscation and size reduction.

**Remember**: ProGuard issues often manifest as runtime errors, not compile-time errors. Thorough testing is essential!
