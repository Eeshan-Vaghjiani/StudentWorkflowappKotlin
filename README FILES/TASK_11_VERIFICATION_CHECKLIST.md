---

## Code Implementation Verification

### TaskRepository.kt
- [x] `getUserTasks()` returns `Result<List<FirebaseTask>>`
- [x] `getUserTasks()` uses `safeFirestoreCall` for error handling
- [x] `getUserTasks()` properly maps document IDs to task objects
- [x] `createTask()` returns `Result<String>` instead of `String?`
- [x] `createTask()` uses `safeFirestoreCall` for error handling
- [x] `createTask()` initializes all required fields:
  - [x] userId
  - [x] createdAt
  - [x] updatedAt
  - [x] status (defaults to "pending")
  - [x] category (defaults to "personal")
  - [x] priority (defaults to "medium")
- [x] `createTask()` schedules reminder notification
- [x] `createTask()` logs successful creation
- [x] Real-time listeners use `Flow` with `callbackFlow`
- [x] Queries use `whereEqualTo("userId", userId)` matching security rules

### TasksViewModel.kt
- [x] Uses `AndroidViewModel` with application context
- [x] Has `TaskRepository` instance
- [x] Has `tasks` StateFlow for task list
- [x] Has `isLoading` StateFlow for loading state
- [x] Has `error` StateFlow for error handling
- [x] Has `successMessage` StateFlow for success feedback
- [x] `init` block sets up real-time listener
- [x] `setupRealTimeListener()` collects from `repository.getUserTasksFlow()`
- [x] `loadUserTasks()` handles manual refresh
- [x] `createTask()` handles `Result<String>` with fold
- [x] `createTask()` sets appropriate error types
- [x] `createTask()` sets success message
- [x] `updateTask()` handles errors properly
- [x] `deleteTask()` handles errors properly
- [x] `clearError()` method available
- [x] `clearSuccessMessage()` method available

### TasksFragment.kt
- [x] Uses `viewModels()` delegate for ViewModel
- [x] Removed direct TaskRepository usage for task operations
- [x] `observeViewModel()` method replaces `setupRealTimeListeners()`
- [x] Observes `viewModel.tasks` StateFlow
- [x] Observes `viewModel.isLoading` StateFlow
- [x] Observes `viewModel.error` StateFlow
- [x] Observes `viewModel.successMessage` StateFlow
- [x] `showError()` method displays errors with Snackbar
- [x] `showSuccess()` method displays success messages
- [x] Error Snackbar includes "Retry" action
- [x] Filter buttons don't recreate listeners
- [x] Filter buttons update UI with existing data
- [x] `refreshData()` calls `viewModel.loadUserTasks()`
- [x] Task creation dialog calls `viewModel.createTask()`
- [x] No manual success/error handling in dialog
- [x] Uses `viewLifecycleOwner` for lifecycle-aware collection

- ✅ Calendar integration verified
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created

### Pending Items
- ⏳ Manual testing o
### Issue: Tasks don't appear immediately
**Solution:** Check real-time listener is set up in TasksViewModel init block

### Issue: Permission denied errors
**Solution:** Verify security rules deployed and use correct userId field

### Issue: Calendar doesn't show tasks

### Issue: Build errors
**Solution:** Firebase DataConnect errors are unrelated, task implementation is complete
