# Task 6: Build Instructions

## Build Issue Resolution

The implementation is complete, but you may encounter a ViewBinding error for `loadMoreProgressBar` until the project is rebuilt.

### Why This Happens
- ViewBinding classes are auto-generated during the build process
- We added a new view (`loadMoreProgressBar`) to the layout XML
- The binding class needs to be regenerated to include this new view
- File locks from Android Studio can prevent the build from completing

### How to Fix

#### Option 1: Rebuild in Android Studio (Recommended)
1. Close any running emulators or devices
2. In Android Studio, go to **Build > Clean Project**
3. Wait for it to complete
4. Then go to **Build > Rebuild Project**
5. The `ActivityChatRoomBinding` class will be regenerated with the new view

#### Option 2: Command Line Build
1. Close Android Studio completely
2. Open a terminal in the project directory
3. Run: `./gradlew clean assembleDebug`
4. Reopen Android Studio

#### Option 3: Sync Gradle Files
1. In Android Studio, click **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files**
2. Wait for sync to complete
3. If error persists, try Option 1

### Verification

After rebuilding, the error should be resolved. You can verify by:
1. Opening `ChatRoomActivity.kt`
2. The line `binding.loadMoreProgressBar.visibility` should no longer show an error
3. You should be able to Ctrl+Click on `loadMoreProgressBar` to navigate to the binding class

### What Was Added

The following view was added to `activity_chat_room.xml`:

```xml
<!-- Load More Progress Bar -->
<ProgressBar
    android:id="@+id/loadMoreProgressBar"
    style="?android:attr/progressBarStyleSmall"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_marginTop="8dp"
    android:visibility="gone"
    app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@id/toolbar"
    tools:visibility="visible" />
```

This progress bar appears at the top of the messages when loading older messages.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Repository**: `loadMoreMessages()` function added
✅ **ViewModel**: Pagination logic and state management added
✅ **Activity**: Scroll listener and observer added
✅ **Layout**: Loading indicator added
⏳ **Build**: Needs rebuild to generate ViewBinding class

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild the project using one of the options above
2. Run the app on a device/emulator
3. Test pagination by scrolling to the top of a chat with 50+ messages
4. Refer to `TASK_6_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing instructions
