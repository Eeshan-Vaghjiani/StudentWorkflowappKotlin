- ✅ Created RecyclerView with dummy task data showing different task statuses
- ✅ Implemented quick action buttons (New Task, Kanban View, AI Assistant, Export)
- ✅ Added proper toolbar with filter, search, and add task buttons
- ✅ All buttons show Toast messages for user feedback

#### 2. **Groups Fragment Conversion** (`fragment_groups.xml` + `GroupsFragment.kt`)
- ✅ Converted `groups.html` to native Android layout
- ✅ Implemented group statistics (5 My Groups, 12 Active Assignments, 3 New Messages)
- ✅ Added quick action buttons (Create Group, Join Group, Assignments, Group Chat)
- ✅ Created "My Groups" section with RecyclerView showing 5 dummy groups
- ✅ Added "Recent Activity" section with 3 activity items
- ✅ Implemented "Discover Groups" section with joinable groups
- ✅ All interactive elements provide user feedback via Toast messages

#### 3. **Data Models & Adapters**
- ✅ Created `Task.kt` data class with status, colors, and metadata
- ✅ Created `Group.kt`, `Activity.kt`, and `DiscoverGroup.kt` data classes
- ✅ Implemented `TaskAdapter.kt` with proper styling for different task statuses
- ✅ Implemented `GroupAdapter.kt`, `ActivityAdapter.kt`, and `DiscoverGroupAdapter.kt`
- ✅ Added proper color coding and icon handling for all list items

#### 4. **UI Components & Styling**
- ✅ Created 4 item layout files: `item_task.xml`, `item_group.xml`, `item_activity.xml`, `item_discover_group.xml`
- ✅ Added 12+ Material Design icons (filter, search, add, list, person, assignment, etc.)
- ✅ Implemented proper color scheme matching the HTML design
- ✅ Used Material Components: CardView, ConstraintLayout, RecyclerView, Chips, Buttons
- ✅ Added proper spacing, elevation, and corner radius for modern Android look

#### 5. **String Resources & Localization**
- ✅ Added 30+ string resources for all UI text
- ✅ Added Toast message strings for user interactions
- ✅ Properly externalized all hardcoded strings

#### 6. **Integration with Existing Project**
- ✅ Maintained existing Firebase Authentication setup
- ✅ Preserved existing MainActivity with BottomNavigationView
- ✅ Updated build.gradle.kts with required dependencies (RecyclerView, CoordinatorLayout)
- ✅ Ensured fragments work within existing navigation structure

### Key Features Implemented:

#### Tasks Screen:
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Shows overdue (8), due today (12), and completed (45) tasks
- **Category Filtering**: Buttons for All Tasks, Personal, Group, and Assignments
- **Task List**: RecyclerView with 5 sample tasks showing different statuses and due dates
- **Quick Actions**: New Task, Kanban View, AI Assistant, and Export buttons
- **Interactive Elements**: All buttons provide Toast feedback

#### Groups Screen:
- **Group Statistics**: Shows 5 groups, 12 active assignments, 3 new messages
- **My Groups**: List of 5 joined groups with member counts and activity status
- **Recent Activity**: 3 recent activities (messages, assignments, new members)
- **Discover Groups**: 2 groups available to join with "Join" buttons
- **Quick Actions**: Create Group, Join Group, Assignments, and Group Chat

### Technical Implementation:

#### Architecture:
- **MVVM Pattern Ready**: Fragments are structured to easily add ViewModels later
- **RecyclerView Pattern**: Proper adapter pattern with ViewHolders
- **Material Design**: Uses Material Components throughout
- **Responsive Layout**: Proper constraint layouts and scrollable content

#### Code Quality:
- **Kotlin**: All new code written in modern Kotlin
- **Type Safety**: Proper type annotations and null safety
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks for color parsing and resource loading
- **Clean Code**: Well-structured classes with single responsibility

### Next Steps for Full Implementation:

1. **Firebase Integration**: Replace dummy data with Firebase Firestore
2. **User Authentication**: Connect tasks and groups to authenticated users
3. **Real-time Updates**: Add Firebase listeners for live data updates
4. **Navigation**: Implement detailed task and group screens
5. **Notifications**: Add push notifications for due tasks and group activities
6. **Offline Support**: Implement local caching with Room database

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- All layouts compile without errors
- All Kotlin code compiles successfully
- APK builds successfully
- Ready for testing and further development

The conversion maintains the original HTML design's look and feel while providing a native Android experience with proper Material Design components and interactions.
