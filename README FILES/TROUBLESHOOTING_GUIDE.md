   - "GroupsFragment loaded successfully!" when you tap Groups
3. If you don't see these toasts, the fragments aren't loading

## üö® **Common Issues and Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: App Crashes on Fragment Load**
**Solution:** Check Logcat for the exact error. Usually missing resources or layout issues.

### **Issue 2: Fragments Show But Are Empty/White**
**Solution:** 
1. Check if RecyclerView adapters are being set properly
2. Verify all drawable resources exist
3. Check if colors are properly defined

### **Issue 3: Buttons Don't Respond**
**Solution:** 
1. Check if click listeners are properly set
2. Verify button IDs match between layout and code
3. Look for Toast messages when buttons are clicked

### **Issue 4: Build Errors**
**Solution:**
1. Check if all dependencies are properly added to build.gradle.kts
2. Verify all string resources are defined
3. Ensure all drawable icons exist

## üì± **Testing Steps:**

1. **Login/Register** - Should work as before with Firebase
2. **Navigate to Tasks** - Should show the new Tasks UI with statistics and task list
3. **Navigate to Groups** - Should show the new Groups UI with group management
4. **Click Buttons** - Should show Toast messages for all interactive elements
5. **Scroll Lists** - Should see sample data in RecyclerViews

## üîç **Debug Commands (if needed):**

If you need to debug from command line:
```bash
# Stop all Gradle daemons
./gradlew --stop

# Clean build (close Android Studio first)
./gradlew clean

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on device/emulator
./gradlew installDebug
```

## üìã **Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] Android Studio restarted
- [ ] Project cleaned and rebuilt
- [ ] Caches invalidated
- [ ] App runs without crashes
- [ ] Toast messages appear when switching to Tasks/Groups
- [ ] Tasks screen shows statistics and task list
- [ ] Groups screen shows statistics and group lists
- [ ] Buttons show Toast messages when clicked
- [ ] RecyclerViews display sample data

## üÜò **If Still Not Working:**

1. **Check Android Studio version** - Should be Arctic Fox or newer
2. **Check Gradle version** - Should be 8.0+
3. **Check compileSdk** - Should be 34
4. **Verify device/emulator** - Try different API levels (28-34)

## üìû **Next Steps:**

Once you confirm the UI is working:
1. The conversion is complete and successful
2. You can start integrating with Firebase Database
3. Replace dummy data with real user data
4. Add navigation to detailed screens
5. Implement real functionality for buttons

The current implementation provides a solid foundation with:
- ‚úÖ Native Android UI matching your HTML design
- ‚úÖ Material Design components
- ‚úÖ Proper fragment navigation
- ‚úÖ RecyclerView lists with adapters
- ‚úÖ Interactive elements with feedback
- ‚úÖ Proper color scheme and styling
