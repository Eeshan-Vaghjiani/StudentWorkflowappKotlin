- ✅ Implement cache size limits
- ✅ Use RecyclerView ViewHolder pattern efficiently
- ✅ Avoid loading large bitmaps into memory
- ✅ Test on low-end devices

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Memory Monitoring

#### Using Memory Monitor Activity
- [ ] Open Debug Activity from the app
- [ ] Tap "Memory Monitor" button
- [ ] Verify memory statistics are displayed
- [ ] Verify statistics auto-refresh every 2 seconds
- [ ] Check that memory status shows correct state (Good/Low/Critical)
- [ ] Verify cache statistics are displayed
- [ ] Check memory and disk cache sizes
- [ ] Verify recommended image dimensions are shown

#### Using Android Profiler
- [ ] Open Android Studio
- [ ] Run app on device/emulator
- [ ] Open Profiler (View > Tool Windows > Profiler)
- [ ] Select Memory profiler
- [ ] Navigate through app (chats, images, tasks)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage stays under 100MB for typical usage
- [ ] Check for memory leaks (no continuously increasing baseline)
- [ ] Verify GC events are reasonable (not excessive)

### 2. Cache Clearing

#### Manual Cache Clearing
- [ ] Open Memory Monitor Activity
- [ ] Note current cache sizes
- [ ] Tap "Clear Cache" button
- [ ] Verify cache sizes drop to near zero
- [ ] Navigate to chat with images
- [ ] Verify images reload from network/Firestore
- [ ] Check cache sizes increase as images load

#### Automatic Cache Clearing (Low Memory)
- [ ] Simulate low memory using ADB:
  ```bash
  adb shell am send-trim-memory com.example.loginandregistration RUNNING_LOW
  ```
- [ ] Check logcat for "Low memory - clearing memory cache" message
- [ ] Verify memory cache is cleared
- [ ] Verify disk cache is NOT cleared (only memory)

#### Automatic Cache Clearing (Critical Memory)
- [ ] Simulate critical memory using ADB:
  ```bash
  adb shell am send-trim-memory com.example.loginandregistration RUNNING_CRITICAL
  ```
- [ ] Check logcat for "Critical memory - clearing all image caches" message
- [ ] Verify both memory and disk caches are cleared
- [ ] Verify app continues to function normally

### 3. Cache Size Limits

#### Memory Cache
- [ ] Open Memory Monitor Activity
- [ ] Verify memory cache max size is ~25% of app memory
- [ ] Load multiple images in chats
- [ ] Verify memory cache size doesn't exceed max size
- [ ] Verify old images are evicted when cache is full

#### Disk Cache
- [ ] Open Memory Monitor Activity
- [ ] Verify disk cache max size is 50MB
- [ ] Load many images over time
- [ ] Verify disk cache size doesn't exceed 50MB
- [ ] Verify old images are evicted when cache is full

### 4. RecyclerView ViewHolder Pattern

#### MessageAdapter
- [ ] Open a chat with many messages
- [ ] Scroll up and down rapidly
- [ ] Verify scrolling is smooth (no lag)
- [ ] Check Android Profiler for excessive allocations
- [ ] Verify views are being recycled (not recreated)

#### ChatAdapter
- [ ] Open chat list with many chats
- [ ] Scroll up and down rapidly
- [ ] Verify scrolling is smooth
- [ ] Check Android Profiler for excessive allocations
- [ ] Verify views are being recycled

#### CalendarTaskAdapter
- [ ] Open calendar with many tasks
- [ ] Select different dates
- [ ] Verify task list updates smoothly
- [ ] Check for efficient view recycling

### 5. Bitmap Loading Optimization

#### Efficient Sampling
- [ ] Select a large image (> 5MB) from gallery
- [ ] Send in chat
- [ ] Verify image compresses without OOM error
- [ ] Check logcat for "Decoded bitmap dimensions" message
- [ ] Verify final dimensions are reasonable (≤ 1920x1080)

#### Memory-Aware Loading
- [ ] Simulate low memory condition
- [ ] Try to load/send an image
- [ ] Verify app uses reduced dimensions (800x800)
- [ ] Check logcat for "Low memory detected - using reduced dimensions"
- [ ] Verify image still loads successfully

#### Bitmap Recycling
- [ ] Enable strict mode in debug build
- [ ] Load and send multiple images
- [ ] Verify no bitmap-related warnings in logcat
- [ ] Check that bitmaps are recycled after use

### 6. Low-End Device Testing

#### Test Device Requirements
- Device with < 2GB RAM OR
- Emulator with 512MB - 1GB RAM OR
- Android API 23-26 (older versions)

#### Tests on Low-End Device
- [ ] Install app on low-end device
- [ ] Open Memory Monitor Activity
- [ ] Verify memory status and recommended dimensions
- [ ] Open chat with images
- [ ] Verify images load (may be smaller dimensions)
- [ ] Send an image
- [ ] Verify compression works without crash
- [ ] Navigate through multiple screens
- [ ] Verify app remains responsive
- [ ] Check for any OOM crashes
- [ ] Verify cache clearing works properly

### 7. Checkpoint 9: Performance Testing

#### Open Chat with Many Messages
- [ ] Create or open a chat with 100+ messages
- [ ] Scroll to top
- [ ] Verify pagination loads more messages smoothly
- [ ] Check memory usage in Memory Monitor
- [ ] Verify memory usage is reasonable

#### Multiple Chats with Images
- [ ] Open multiple chats with images
- [ ] Navigate between chats
- [ ] Verify images load quickly from cache
- [ ] Check cache hit rate in Memory Monitor
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks

#### Memory Usage Monitoring
- [ ] Open Android Profiler
- [ ] Use app for 5-10 minutes
- [ ] Navigate through all screens
- [ ] Load images, send messages, view tasks
- [ ] Monitor memory usage graph
- [ ] Verify no continuous memory growth
- [ ] Verify memory stays under 150MB

#### Responsiveness Test
- [ ] Open chat with many messages and images
- [ ] Scroll rapidly up and down
- [ ] Verify no lag or stuttering
- [ ] Send a message
- [ ] Verify immediate response
- [ ] Open image viewer
- [ ] Verify smooth transitions

#### Low-End Device Test
- [ ] Repeat all above tests on low-end device
- [ ] Verify app remains responsive
- [ ] Check for any crashes or ANRs
- [ ] Verify memory management works correctly
