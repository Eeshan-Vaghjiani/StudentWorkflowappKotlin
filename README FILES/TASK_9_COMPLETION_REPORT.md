   - This is intentional to not block user experience
   - Error is logged for debugging

2. **Firestore Write Failure**
   - Login continues even if user document creation/update fails
   - This is intentional to not block authentication
   - Error is logged for debugging

3. **Network Timeout**
   - Uses default Firebase timeout settings
   - May need adjustment for very slow networks
   - Can be configured if needed
