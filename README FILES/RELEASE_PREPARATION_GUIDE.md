---

## üîß Remaining Tasks

### 6. Generate Signing Key and Configure Signing

#### Step 1: Generate Keystore

Run this command to create a keystore for signing your app:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore teamsync-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias teamsync-key
```

**Important:**
- Store the keystore file in a secure location (NOT in the project directory)
- Remember your passwords - you'll need them for every release
- Back up the keystore file - losing it means you can't update your app

#### Step 2: Configure Signing in Build

1. Create or update `local.properties` (this file is gitignored):

```properties
# Signing configuration
KEYSTORE_FILE=C:/path/to/teamsync-release-key.jks
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_keystore_password
KEY_ALIAS=teamsync-key
KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

2. Update `app/build.gradle.kts` to read from local.properties:

```kotlin
// Read signing config from local.properties
val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("local.properties")
val keystoreProperties = Properties()
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

android {
    // ... existing config ...
    
    signingConfigs {
        create("release") {
            storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["KEYSTORE_FILE"] ?: "")
            storePassword = keystoreProperties["KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"] as String?
            keyAlias = keystoreProperties["KEY_ALIAS"] as String?
            keyPassword = keystoreProperties["KEY_PASSWORD"] as String?
        }
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
            // ... rest of config ...
        }
    }
}
```

### 7. Build Release APK/AAB

#### Build APK (for testing):
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
Output: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/TeamSync-v1.0.0-release.apk`

#### Build AAB (for Play Store):
```bash
./gradlew bundleRelease
```
Output: `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/TeamSync-v1.0.0-release.aab`

### 8. Test Signed Build

1. Install the release APK on a physical device:
```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/TeamSync-v1.0.0-release.apk
```

1. Login/Welcome screen
