# Quick Fix Summary - Package Name Issue

## Problem
```
No matching client found for package name 'com.example.loginandregistration.debug'
```

## Root Cause
- `google-services.json` only has: `com.example.loginandregistration`
- Debug builds were trying to use: `com.example.loginandregistration.debug`
- Firebase didn't recognize the `.debug` suffix

## Solution Applied ✅

### Changed in `app/build.gradle.kts`:

1. **Set applicationId to match Firebase**:
   ```kotlin
   applicationId = "com.example.loginandregistration"
   ```

2. **Removed debug suffix**:
   ```kotlin
   debug {
       // applicationIdSuffix = ".debug"  // COMMENTED OUT
       versionNameSuffix = "-debug"
   }
   ```

## What You Need to Do

### Quick Steps:
1. **Close Android Studio** completely
2. **Reopen Android Studio**
3. **Sync Gradle** (File → Sync Project with Gradle Files)
4. **Build** (Build → Rebuild Project or click Run)

### If That Doesn't Work:
1. Close Android Studio
2. Delete these folders:
   - `build/`
   - `app/build/`
   - `.gradle/`
3. Reopen Android Studio
4. Sync and build

## Result
✅ Package name matches Firebase  
✅ Build should succeed  
✅ App should run  

## Trade-off
⚠️ **Note**: Debug and release builds now use the same package name, so you can't install both versions on the same device simultaneously.

If you need both versions installed:
- Add `com.example.loginandregistration.debug` to Firebase Console
- Download new `google-services.json`
- Uncomment the `applicationIdSuffix` line

## Files Modified
- ✅ `app/build.gradle.kts` - Updated applicationId and commented debug suffix
