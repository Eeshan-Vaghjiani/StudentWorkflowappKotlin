### On Physical Device:
1. Enable Developer Options on your phone
2. Enable USB Debugging
3. Connect phone via USB
4. Click Run button in Android Studio
5. Select your device

## 🐛 Common Issues:

### Build Fails with "File Locked":
- Close Android Studio
- Run `./gradlew --stop`
- Delete `app/build` folder
- Restart and build

### "google-services.json not found":
- Download from Firebase Console
- Place in `app/` directory

## 🎯 Development Workflow:

1. **I implement features** → You review
2. **Build and test** → Report issues
3. **I fix issues** → You test again
4. **Feature complete** → Move to next phase

## 📞 Communication:

### When Build Succeeds:
Say: "Build succeeded, proceed with Phase 2"

### When You Find a Bug:
Provide:
- What you did (steps to reproduce)
- What happened (actual behavior)
- What you expected (expected behavior)
- Error message (if any)

### When You Want to Test:
Say: "Ready to test [feature name]"

## ⏱️ Timeline:
