## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### App Won't Build

**Problem**: Gradle sync fails or build errors

**Solutions**:
1. Check that `google-services.json` is in the `app/` directory
2. Sync Gradle files: File ‚Üí Sync Project with Gradle Files
3. Clean and rebuild: Build ‚Üí Clean Project, then Build ‚Üí Rebuild Project
4. Invalidate caches: File ‚Üí Invalidate Caches / Restart
5. Check internet connection for dependency downloads

#### Login Fails

**Problem**: "Authentication failed" error

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Firebase Authentication is enabled in Firebase Console
2. Check that Email/Password provider is enabled
3. Verify `google-services.json` is correct
4. Check internet connection
5. Try registering a new account first

#### Messages Not Sending

**Problem**: Messages stuck in "Sending" status

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Firestore is enabled in Firebase Console
3. Check Firestore security rules are deployed
4. Try logging out and back in
5. Clear app data and login again

#### Notifications Not Working

**Problem**: Not receiving push notifications

**Solutions**:
1. Grant notification permission: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Team Collaboration ‚Üí Notifications
2. Verify FCM is enabled in Firebase Console
3. Check that app is not in battery optimization mode
4. Restart the device
5. Reinstall the app

#### Images Not Loading

**Problem**: Profile pictures or chat images don't display

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Clear app cache: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Team Collaboration ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Cache
3. Verify images were uploaded successfully
4. Check that base64 data is not corrupted
5. Try uploading a smaller image

#### Calendar Not Showing Tasks

**Problem**: Calendar view is empty or tasks don't appear

**Solutions**:
1. Verify tasks have due dates set
2. Pull down to refresh
3. Check filter settings (All Tasks vs My Tasks)
4. Verify you're assigned to the tasks
5. Check Firestore indexes are deployed

#### Offline Mode Issues

**Problem**: App doesn't work offline or messages don't sync

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you've loaded data while online first
2. Check that Firestore offline persistence is enabled
3. Clear app data and reload while online
4. Verify connection monitor is working
5. Check queued messages in app storage

### Performance Issues

#### App is Slow

**Solutions**:
1. Clear image cache: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Team Collaboration ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Cache
2. Reduce number of loaded messages (pagination helps)
3. Close and restart the app
4. Check device storage space
5. Update to latest version

#### High Battery Usage

**Solutions**:
1. Disable background sync if not needed
2. Reduce notification frequency
3. Close app when not in use
4. Check for app updates
5. Restart device

### Error Messages

#### "Permission Denied"

**Cause**: Firestore security rules blocking access

**Solution**: Verify security rules are deployed correctly and user is authenticated

#### "Network Error"

**Cause**: No internet connection or Firebase services down

**Solution**: Check internet connection, try again later, or check Firebase status

#### "Storage Limit Exceeded"

**Cause**: Firestore document size limit (1MB) exceeded

**Solution**: Reduce image size, compress more aggressively, or use smaller images

#### "Invalid Token"

**Cause**: FCM token expired or invalid

**Solution**: Logout and login again to refresh token

## üîí Security and Privacy

### Data Security

- All data is stored in Firebase Firestore with security rules
- Only authenticated users can access data
- Users can only access groups they're members of
