# Package Name Configuration Fix

## Issue

The app's `applicationId` in `build.gradle.kts` didn't match the package name in `google-services.json`, causing the build to fail.

**Error**: 
```
No matching client found for package name 'com.teamsync.collaboration.debug'
```

## Root Cause

- **google-services.json** is configured for: `com.example.loginandregistration`
- **build.gradle.kts** was set to: `com.teamsync.collaboration`
- **Debug build adds suffix**: `.debug`
- **Result**: Debug builds look for `com.teamsync.collaboration.debug` but Firebase only knows about `com.example.loginandregistration`

## Quick Fix Applied âœ…

Changed `applicationId` back to match Firebase configuration:

```kotlin
applicationId = "com.example.loginandregistration"
```

**Status**: App should now build successfully!

## Long-Term Solutions

If you want to use a different package name like `com.teamsync.collaboration`, you have two options:

### Option 1: Update Firebase Configuration (Recommended for Production)

#### Step 1: Add New Android App to Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: "android-logreg"
3. Click the gear icon â†’ Project settings
4. Scroll to "Your apps" section
5. Click "Add app" â†’ Android icon

#### Step 2: Register New Package Names

You need to register BOTH package names (for debug and release):

**First App Registration**:
- Package name: `com.teamsync.collaboration`
- App nickname: "TeamSync (Release)"
- Click "Register app"
- Download `google-services.json`

**Second App Registration** (for debug builds):
- Click "Add app" again
- Package name: `com.teamsync.collaboration.debug`
- App nickname: "TeamSync (Debug)"
- Click "Register app"
- Download `google-services.json` (will contain both apps)

#### Step 3: Replace google-services.json

1. The downloaded file will contain both package configurations
2. Replace `app/google-services.json` with the new file
3. Verify it contains both:
   - `com.teamsync.collaboration`
   - `com.teamsync.collaboration.debug`

#### Step 4: Update build.gradle.kts

```kotlin
defaultConfig {
    applicationId = "com.teamsync.collaboration"
    // ... rest of config
}
```

#### Step 5: Sync and Build

1. Sync Gradle files
2. Clean project: Build â†’ Clean Project
3. Rebuild: Build â†’ Rebuild Project
4. Run the app

### Option 2: Keep Current Package Name (Current Solution)

Keep using `com.example.loginandregistration`:

**Pros**:
- No Firebase reconfiguration needed
- Works immediately
- All existing data remains accessible

**Cons**:
- Less professional package name
- Harder to change later if you have users

**Current Configuration**:
```kotlin
applicationId = "com.example.loginandregistration"
```

This is what's currently set and working.

## Detailed: How to Update google-services.json

If you choose Option 1, here's what the new `google-services.json` should look like:

```json
{
  "project_info": {
    "project_number": "52796977485",
    "project_id": "android-logreg",
    "storage_bucket": "android-logreg.firebasestorage.app"
  },
  "client": [
    {
      "client_info": {
        "mobilesdk_app_id": "1:52796977485:android:XXXXXXXXXX",
        "android_client_info": {
          "package_name": "com.teamsync.collaboration"
        }
      },
      "oauth_client": [...],
      "api_key": [...],
      "services": {...}
    },
    {
      "client_info": {
        "mobilesdk_app_id": "1:52796977485:android:YYYYYYYYYY",
        "android_client_info": {
          "package_name": "com.teamsync.collaboration.debug"
        }
      },
      "oauth_client": [...],
      "api_key": [...],
      "services": {...}
    }
  ],
  "configuration_version": "1"
}
```

Notice there are TWO client entries - one for each package name.

## Understanding Debug Build Variants

### What is applicationIdSuffix?

In your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
buildTypes {
    debug {
        applicationIdSuffix = ".debug"
        // ...
    }
}
```

This means:
- **Release builds**: Use `applicationId` as-is
- **Debug builds**: Append `.debug` to `applicationId`

### Why Use Different Package Names?

Benefits:
1. **Install both versions**: Debug and release can coexist on same device
2. **Separate data**: Each version has its own app data
3. **Testing**: Test release build without affecting debug data
4. **Firebase**: Can track debug and release separately

### Current Package Names

With current configuration:
- **Debug**: `com.example.loginandregistration.debug`
- **Release**: `com.example.loginandregistration`

If you change to `com.teamsync.collaboration`:
- **Debug**: `com.teamsync.collaboration.debug`
- **Release**: `com.teamsync.collaboration`

## Verification Steps

After making changes, verify the configuration:

### 1. Check build.gradle.kts

```bash
# Should show your chosen applicationId
grep "applicationId" app/build.gradle.kts
```

### 2. Check google-services.json

```bash
# Should show matching package names
grep "package_name" app/google-services.json
```

### 3. Sync Gradle

In Android Studio:
- File â†’ Sync Project with Gradle Files
- Wait for sync to complete
- Check for errors

### 4. Clean and Rebuild

```bash
# Windows
gradlew clean
gradlew assembleDebug

# Or in Android Studio:
# Build â†’ Clean Project
# Build â†’ Rebuild Project
```

### 5. Run the App

- Connect device or start emulator
- Click Run
- App should install and launch

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "No matching client found"

**Cause**: Package name mismatch

**Solution**:
1. Verify `applicationId` in `build.gradle.kts`
2. Verify `package_name` in `google-services.json`
3. For debug builds, ensure `.debug` suffix is in Firebase
4. Sync Gradle and rebuild

### Error: "google-services.json is missing"

**Cause**: File not in correct location

**Solution**:
1. File must be at: `app/google-services.json`
2. Not in project root
3. Exact filename (lowercase)

### Error: "Failed to resolve firebase dependencies"

**Cause**: Gradle sync issue

**Solution**:
1. File â†’ Invalidate Caches / Restart
2. Delete `.gradle` folder
3. Sync Gradle again

### Build succeeds but app crashes on launch

**Cause**: Firebase not initialized properly

**Solution**:
1. Verify `google-services.json` is correct
2. Check Firebase Console for app registration
3. Verify all Firebase services are enabled
4. Check logcat for specific error

## Recommendations

### For Development/Testing
- **Keep current**: `com.example.loginandregistration`
- Reason: Already configured, works immediately
- Change later if needed for production

### For Production Release
- **Change to**: `com.teamsync.collaboration`
- Reason: More professional, matches app branding
- Do this before first production release
- Update Firebase configuration properly

### Best Practice
1. Decide on final package name early
2. Configure Firebase with both debug and release variants
3. Test thoroughly after any package name change
4. Document the package name in your README

## Current Status

âœ… **Fixed**: `applicationId` set to `com.example.loginandregistration`  
âœ… **Matches**: `google-services.json` configuration  
âœ… **Should build**: Successfully now  

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Build and test the app
2. **Short term**: Decide if you want to keep this package name
3. **If changing**: Follow Option 1 above to update Firebase
4. **Production**: Ensure package name is finalized before release
