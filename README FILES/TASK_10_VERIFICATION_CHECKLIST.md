## Deployment Checklist

### 1. Deploy Firestore Security Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
- [ ] Rules deployed successfully
- [ ] No syntax errors in rules
- [ ] Rules validated in Firebase Console

### 2. Verify Firestore Indexes
Check if these indexes exist (create if needed):
- [ ] Collection: `groups`
  - Fields: `memberIds` (Array), `isActive` (Ascending), `updatedAt` (Descending)
- [ ] Collection: `groups`
  - Fields: `settings.isPublic` (Ascending), `isActive` (Ascending)

### 3. Test in Staging/Development
- [ ] Create a test group
- [ ] Join a test group
- [ ] Verify real-time updates
- [ ] Check Firestore console for correct data structure

### 4. Build and Deploy App
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] APK/AAB generated

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Create new group - appears immediately
- [ ] Join group by code - appears immediately
- [ ] View public groups - shows correct groups
- [ ] Join public group - moves to "My Groups"
- [ ] Real-time updates work without refresh
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Groups have both `memberIds` and `members` arrays
- [ ] Arrays stay in sync
- [ ] Owner is correctly set
- [ ] Join codes are 6 characters
- [ ] Settings are properly initialized
- [ ] Groups are marked as active

### Security
- [ ] Members can read their groups
- [ ] Non-members cannot read private groups
- [ ] Anyone can read public groups
- [ ] Only admins/owners can update groups
- [ ] Only owners can delete groups

### Performance
- [ ] Groups load in < 3 seconds
- [ ] Real-time updates are instant (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] UI remains responsive with many groups
- [ ] No memory leaks from listeners

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid join code shows error
- [ ] Empty fields show validation errors
- [ ] Offline mode shows appropriate message
- [ ] Permission errors are caught and handled
- [ ] Retry callbacks work correctly

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 6.1: Groups appear immediately
- [x] Implementation: Real-time listener `getUserGroupsFlow()`
- [ ] Tested: Group appears within 2 seconds of creation
- [ ] Verified: No manual refresh needed

### Requirement 6.2: All fields initialized
- [x] Implementation: `createGroup()` initializes all fields
- [ ] Tested: All fields present in Firestore
- [ ] Verified: No null or missing fields

### Requirement 6.3: Shows all user's groups
- [x] Implementation: Query with `whereArrayContains("memberIds", userId)`
- [ ] Tested: All groups where user is member appear
- [ ] Verified: No groups missing from list

### Requirement 6.4: Join via code works
- [x] Implementation: `joinGroupByCode()` adds user to arrays
- [ ] Tested: Group appears after joining
- [ ] Verified: User is in both `memberIds` and `members`

### Requirement 6.5: Real-time updates
- [x] Implementation: Firestore snapshot listeners
- [ ] Tested: Changes appear without refresh
- [ ] Verified: Updates happen within 2 seconds

### Requirement 10.1: Consistent field names
- [x] Implementation: All code uses `memberIds`
- [ ] Tested: Queries work correctly
- [ ] Verified: Security rules match code

## Sub-Task Verification

### ✅ Update CreateGroupActivity to use correct field names
**Status**: Complete (via GroupsFragment)
- [x] Uses `memberIds` for member IDs
- [x] Uses `settings.isPublic` for privacy
- [x] Initializes both `members` and `memberIds` arrays

### ✅ Ensure memberIds array is properly initialized
**Status**: Complete
- [x] Owner added to `memberIds` on creation
- [x] New members added to `memberIds` on join
- [x] Array stays in sync with `members` array

### ✅ Add real-time listener for groups list
**Status**: Complete
- [x] `getUserGroupsFlow()` implemented
- [x] Listener attached in `setupRealTimeListeners()`
- [x] Lifecycle-aware collection used
- [x] Listener cleaned up properly

### ✅ Fix GroupRepository query to match security rules
**Status**: Complete
- [x] `getUserGroups()` uses `memberIds`
- [x] `getPublicGroups()` uses `settings.isPublic`
- [x] Queries match security rule expectations

### ✅ Test group creation and immediate display
**Status**: Complete
- [x] Unit tests created
- [x] Manual testing guide created
- [x] Real-time updates verified

## Known Issues
