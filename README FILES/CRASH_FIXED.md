# ✅ Crash Fixed!

## The Problem

The app was crashing with this error:
```
Binary XML file line #10: <bitmap> requires a valid 'src' attribute
File: res/drawable/splash_background.xml
```

## Root Cause

The `splash_background.xml` file had a `<bitmap>` tag trying to use a vector drawable (`ic_app_logo`). 

**Problem**: You cannot use vector drawables directly in `<bitmap>` tags - they only work with actual bitmap images (PNG, JPG, etc.).

## The Fix

Simplified `splash_background.xml` to just show the background color. The splash screen library (AndroidX Core Splash Screen) handles the app icon separately via the theme, so we don't need it in the background drawable.

### Before:
```xml
<layer-list>
    <item android:drawable="@color/colorPrimaryBlue"/>
    <item>
        <bitmap android:src="@drawable/ic_app_logo"/>  <!-- ❌ CRASH -->
    </item>
</layer-list>
```

### After:
```xml
<layer-list>
    <item android:drawable="@color/colorPrimaryBlue"/>  <!-- ✅ WORKS -->
</layer-list>
```

The app icon is still shown on the splash screen via the `Theme.App.SplashScreen` theme which has:
```xml
<item name="windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon">@drawable/ic_app_logo</item>
```
