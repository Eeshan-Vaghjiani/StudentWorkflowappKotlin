## Notes

This task successfully implements image message sending with all required features:
- Image compression using ImageCompressor
- Upload to Firebase Storage with progress tracking
- Message creation and display with Coil
- Error handling and offline support
- Integration with existing chat system

The implementation is clean, well-structured, and follows the design document specifications. All requirements are satisfied, and the feature is ready for user testing.

Next task (Task 16) will implement document message sending using a similar pattern.
