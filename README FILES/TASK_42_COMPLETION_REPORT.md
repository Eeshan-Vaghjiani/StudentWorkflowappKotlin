## 🎯 Requirements Met

### Requirement 10.3: Image Caching
**"WHEN displaying images THEN the system SHALL use memory and disk caching to avoid re-downloading"**

**Status:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation:**
- Memory cache configured at 25% of app memory for instant access
- Disk cache configured at 50MB for offline persistence
- All images automatically cached when loaded
- No re-downloading of previously viewed images
- LRU eviction policy when cache limits reached

### Requirement 10.4: Image Compression Support
**"WHEN uploading images THEN the system SHALL compress them to 80% quality before upload"**

**Status:** ✅ SUPPORTED

**Note:** Image compression is handled by ImageCompressor.kt (Task 13). The caching system ensures compressed images are efficiently cached and reused.

```

### Cache Flow:

1. **Image Request** → Check Memory Cache
2. **Memory Miss** → Check Disk Cache
3. **Disk Miss** → Load from Network
4. **Network Success** → Save to Disk & Memory
5. **Subsequent Requests** → Serve from Cache
