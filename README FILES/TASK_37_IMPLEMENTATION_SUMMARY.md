# Task 37: Firestore Security Rules Implementation

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

All Firestore security rules have been implemented in the `firestore.rules` file at the project root.

## üìã What Was Implemented

### 1. Helper Functions
- `isAuthenticated()` - Checks if user is authenticated
- `isOwner(userId)` - Checks if user owns a resource
- `isMember(groupId)` - Checks if user is a group member
- `isGroupAdmin(groupId)` - Checks if user is a group admin
- `isParticipant(chatId)` - Checks if user is a chat participant
- `isAssignedTo(taskData)` - Checks if user is assigned to a task

### 2. Users Collection Rules
‚úÖ **Authentication check**: All operations require authentication
‚úÖ **Read access**: Any authenticated user can read user profiles (needed for search, chat, member lists)
‚úÖ **Write access**: Users can only write to their own document

### 3. Groups Collection Rules
‚úÖ **Authentication check**: All operations require authentication
‚úÖ **Read access**: Members can read group data, or anyone can read public groups
‚úÖ **Create access**: Any authenticated user can create groups
‚úÖ **Update access**: Only admins or group creators can update
‚úÖ **Delete access**: Only admins or group creators can delete

### 4. Tasks Collection Rules
‚úÖ **Authentication check**: All operations require authentication
‚úÖ **Read access**: Users can read tasks they created or are assigned to
‚úÖ **Create access**: Any authenticated user can create tasks
‚úÖ **Update access**: Task creator or assigned users can update
‚úÖ **Delete access**: Only task creator can delete

### 5. Chats Collection Rules
‚úÖ **Authentication check**: All operations require authentication
‚úÖ **Participant verification**: Only chat participants can access chat data
‚úÖ **Read/Write access**: Only participants can read or write chat metadata

### 6. Messages Subcollection Rules
‚úÖ **Authentication check**: All operations require authentication
‚úÖ **Read access**: Only chat participants can read messages
‚úÖ **Create access**: Only chat participants can send messages
‚úÖ **Update access**: Only message sender can update their messages
‚úÖ **Delete access**: Only message sender can delete their messages

### 7. Additional Collections
‚úÖ **Typing Status**: Participants can read/write typing indicators
‚úÖ **Notifications**: Users can only access their own notifications
‚úÖ **Group Activities**: Members can read, create activities; creators/admins can delete

## üîí Security Features

### Authentication Requirements
- All operations require user authentication (`request.auth != null`)
- Unauthenticated requests are automatically denied

### Ownership Verification
- Users can only modify their own data
- Task creators have full control over their tasks
- Message senders can edit/delete their own messages

### Group Membership Verification
- Group data is only accessible to members
- Admin privileges are enforced for sensitive operations
- Public groups are discoverable by all authenticated users

### Chat Participant Verification
- Only chat participants can access messages
- Prevents unauthorized users from reading private conversations
- Ensures message privacy and security

## üì¶ Requirements Coverage

This implementation satisfies the following requirements:

- ‚úÖ **Requirement 9.1**: Authentication check for all operations
- ‚úÖ **Requirement 9.2**: User ownership rules for users collection
- ‚úÖ **Requirement 9.3**: Group membership rules for groups collection
- ‚úÖ **Requirement 9.6**: Task ownership rules for tasks collection
- ‚úÖ **Additional**: Participant rules for chats collection
- ‚úÖ **Additional**: Sender rules for messages subcollection

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy via Firebase Console (Recommended for Testing)

1. **Open Firebase Console**
   - Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to Firestore Rules**
   - Click on "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
   - Click on the "Rules" tab

3. **Copy and Paste Rules**
   - Open the `firestore.rules` file in your project
   - Copy all the content
   - Paste it into the Firebase Console editor
   - Click "Publish"

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check that the rules are published successfully
   - Note the timestamp of the deployment

### Option 2: Deploy via Firebase CLI (Recommended for Production)

1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase** (if not already done)
   ```bash
   firebase init firestore
   ```
   - Select your Firebase project
   - Accept the default `firestore.rules` file location

4. **Deploy Rules**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   firebase firestore:rules:list
   ```

### Option 3: Deploy via Android Studio Terminal

1. **Open Terminal in Android Studio**
   - View ‚Üí Tool Windows ‚Üí Terminal

2. **Run Deployment Command**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

## üß™ Testing the Rules

### Test 1: User Access
```javascript
// Should succeed: User reading their own profile
firestore.collection('users').doc(currentUserId).get()

// Should fail: User writing to another user's profile
firestore.collection('users').doc(otherUserId).set({...})
```

### Test 2: Group Access
```javascript
// Should succeed: Member reading group data
firestore.collection('groups').doc(groupId).get()

// Should fail: Non-member reading private group
firestore.collection('groups').doc(privateGroupId).get()
```

### Test 3: Chat Access
```javascript
// Should succeed: Participant reading messages
firestore.collection('chats').doc(chatId).collection('messages').get()

// Should fail: Non-participant reading messages
firestore.collection('chats').doc(otherChatId).collection('messages').get()
```

### Test 4: Task Access
```javascript
// Should succeed: Creator or assigned user reading task
firestore.collection('tasks').doc(taskId).get()

// Should fail: Unrelated user reading task
firestore.collection('tasks').doc(otherTaskId).get()
```

### Test 5: Message Operations
```javascript
// Should succeed: Sender deleting their own message
firestore.collection('chats').doc(chatId)
  .collection('messages').doc(myMessageId).delete()

// Should fail: User deleting someone else's message
firestore.collection('chats').doc(chatId)
  .collection('messages').doc(otherMessageId).delete()
```

## üîç Rule Validation

### Using Firebase Emulator (Recommended)

1. **Install Emulator**
   ```bash
   firebase init emulators
   ```
   - Select "Firestore Emulator"

2. **Start Emulator**
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   - Use the Emulator UI at http://localhost:4000
   - Test various scenarios with different user IDs
   - Verify that unauthorized access is denied

### Using Firebase Console Rules Playground

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules
2. Click on "Rules Playground" tab
3. Select a collection and operation
4. Simulate authenticated/unauthenticated requests
5. Verify expected behavior

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**: All rules require authentication. Ensure Firebase Auth is properly configured.

2. **Read Access for Users**: User profiles are readable by all authenticated users. This is necessary for:
   - User search functionality
   - Displaying member lists
   - Showing sender information in chats
   - Profile pictures in messages

3. **Group Document Reads**: The rules use `get()` to fetch group documents for membership verification. This counts toward your Firestore read quota.

4. **Public Groups**: Groups with `isPublic: true` are readable by all authenticated users for discovery purposes.

5. **Message Privacy**: Messages are strictly limited to chat participants. No one else can read them.

### Performance Considerations

1. **Document Reads**: Helper functions that use `get()` count as document reads
2. **Caching**: Firestore caches rule evaluations within a single request
3. **Indexes**: Ensure proper indexes are created for array-contains queries

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Audits**: Review rules periodically for security gaps
2. **Testing**: Test rules after any changes before deploying to production
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor Firebase Console for unauthorized access attempts
4. **Updates**: Update rules when adding new collections or features

## üìù Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Deploy rules to Firebase Console
2. ‚úÖ Test rules with different user scenarios
3. ‚úÖ Verify that unauthorized access is properly denied
4. ‚úÖ Monitor Firebase Console for any rule violations
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Proceed to Task 38: Implement Storage security rules
