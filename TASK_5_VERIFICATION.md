## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

7. ✅ Clear search - verify results clear
8. ✅ Tap a user - verify loading indicator shows
9. ✅ Verify navigation to ChatRoomActivity
10. ✅ Verify chat is created in Firestore
11. ✅ Send a message to verify chat works
12. ✅ Close and reopen - verify chat appears in list

### Edge Cases Handled
