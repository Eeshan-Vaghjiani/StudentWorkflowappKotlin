  - `memberIds` for groups
  - `participants` for chats
  - `userId` for tasks

### 1.2 Deploy Security Rules
```bash
# Deploy only Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Expected output:
# ✔  Deploy complete!
```

### 1.3 Verify Rules in Firebase Console
- [ ] Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
